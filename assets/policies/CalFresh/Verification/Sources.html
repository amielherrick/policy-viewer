  <h1><span data-field="title" data-format="default">Sources of Verification</span></h1>
  <p>[63-300.5(h)]</p>
  <h2>Documentary Evidence</h2>
  <p>The <a href="#" data-popovertext="Eligibility Worker" data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">EW</a> will use documentary evidence as the primary source of verification for all items except residency and household size. These two items may be verified through readily available documentary evidence or through a collateral contact, without a requirement being imposed that documentary evidence must be the primary source of verification. Documentary evidence consists of a written confirmation of a household&#39;s circumstances. Examples of documentary evidence include current wage stubs, rent receipts, medical and utility bills. Statements must be in sufficient detail so that a reviewer would be able to determine the reasonableness of the determination.</p>
  <p><a class="dropspot" data-rhwidget="DropSpot" data-target="drop-down" href="#"><span data-open-text="true" data-skip-index="true">Example</span><span data-close-text="true">Example</span></a></p>
  <div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop-down">
    <p>When income is verified by the presentation of pay stubs or wage statements, the EW must photocopy or record in the case file the following information:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The date of each pay stub or wage statement.</li>
      <li>The name and address of the payer.</li>
      <li>The gross amount of income on each stub or statement.</li>
      <li>The frequency of receipt of income (i.e., weekly, bimonthly, monthly, etc.).</li>
      <li>The specific items and amount of allowable deductions and exclusions.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <ul>
  </ul>
  <p>Although documentary evidence will be the primary source of verification, acceptable verification will not be limited to any single type of document and may be obtained through the household or other source. Whenever documentary evidence is insufficient to make a determination of eligibility or benefit level, the EW may either continue the attempt to obtain sufficient documentary evidence or require a collateral contact or home visit. Whenever documentary evidence cannot be obtained, the EW will require a collateral contact or home visit. For example, documentary evidence may be considered insufficient when the household presents pay stubs which do not represent an accurate picture of the household&#39;s income (such as outdated pay stubs) or identification papers that appear to be falsified.</p>
  <h2>Collateral Contacts</h2>
  <p>A collateral contact is a verbal confirmation of a household&#39;s circumstances by a person outside the household. The collateral contact may be made either in person or over the telephone. The acceptability of a collateral contact will not be restricted to a particular individual but may be anyone that can be expected to provide an accurate third-party verification of the household&#39;s statements. Examples of acceptable collateral contacts are employers, landlords, social services agencies, migrant service agencies, community partners and neighbors of the household.</p>
  <p>The “Collateral Contact Affidavit” (SC 193) is completed by the community partners when they are providing confirmation of household circumstances as collateral contacts. The SC 193 must be filed in fastener 2 in IDM.</p>
  <p>When collateral contacts are used as verification, clear documentation of such must be noted on the <em>Maintain Case Comments </em>window in CalSAWS.</p>
  <p>Systems of records to which the Department of Social Services or the county welfare department has routine access are not considered collateral contacts and, therefore, need not be designated by the household. Examples of such record systems are the <a href="#" data-popovertext="Beneficiary Data Exchange " data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">BENDEX</a> and the <a href="#" data-popovertext="State Data Exchange " data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">SDX</a> and records of any other agency where a routine access agreement exists (such as records from the <a href="#" data-popovertext="Employment Development Department" data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">EDD</a>.</p>
  <h2>Home Visits</h2>
  <p>Home visits may be used as verification when documentary evidence is insufficient to make a determination of eligibility or benefit level or cannot be obtained and the visit is scheduled in advance with the household.</p>
  <h2>Discrepancies</h2>
  <p>When information from another source contradicts statements made by the household, the household will be given a reasonable opportunity to resolve the discrepancy prior to an eligibility determination.</p>
  <h2>Self-Certifications Where Permitted</h2>
  <p>Self-certification should be used in certain circumstances where the household is not able to provide the necessary verification through documentary evidence, collateral contact or home visits. Self-certification can be accepted in certain circumstances <strong>if</strong> all other proof is not available. Self-certification is acceptable as verification for certain eligibility factors such as: certain gross nonexempt income (e.g., cash payment for babysitting or yard work); meeting conditions of eligibility for certain people with drug related felony convictions where the applicant must certify that their illegal use of controlled substances has ceased; or residency for migrant farm workers and homeless households. All other mandatory eligibility factors such as most gross nonexempt income, noncitizen status, identity, SSN, child support payments, residency, utility expenses, medical expenses, sponsored noncitizen information, and disability <strong>require </strong>the household to provide some type of documentary evidence or collateral contact for verification. Thorough case documentation including detailed explanation as to why self certification was accepted, must be entered in the <em>Maintain Case Comments</em> window.</p>
