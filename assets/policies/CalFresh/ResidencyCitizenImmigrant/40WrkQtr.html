  <h1><span data-field="title" data-format="default">Eligibility Based on 40 Work Quarters</span></h1>
  <p>[63.405.4]</p>
  <p>The 2002 Farm Bill significantly expanded the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) eligibility for noncitizens residing in the U.S. in a qualified alien status for five years. It also effectively reduced the applicability of the 40-quarter work requirement for lawful permanent residents (LPRs). These changes include:</p>
  <p> </p>
  <ul class="Disc">
    <li>Noncitizens with qualified alien status became eligible for SNAP after residing in the U.S. for five years.</li>
    <li>Generally, an LPR must have worked for 10 years cumulatively before qualifying for SNAP. Under the 2002 Farm Bill, LPRs now become eligible after five years of U.S. residency, whether or not they have any qualifying quarters.</li>
    <li>The requirement now only applies in specific cases, such as LPRs who have been in the U.S. for less than five years. These individuals may claim 40 qualifying quarters of work by counting quarters credited from a parent&#39;s work earned before the applicant turned 18 or from a spouse&#39;s work.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Procedure</h3>
  <p>For qualified noncitizens whose eligibility must be assessed based on the 40-quarter work requirement, the following steps should be taken:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Have the applicant/recipient complete the SAWS 2 Plus, CF 285, or interactive interview.</li>
    <li>Interview the applicant/recipient to determine how long the noncitizen and their parent(s) or spouse have lived and worked in the United States.</li>
    <li>Interview the applicant/recipient to determine whether the noncitizen and their parent(s) or spouse have ever:
      <ol>
        <li>Commuted to work in the U.S. from another country before coming to live in the U.S or</li>
        <li>Worked for a U.S. company overseas and paid U.S. income taxes or Social Security taxes.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>If the interview results indicate that the noncitizen meets, may meet, or believes that he/she meets the 40 credits of qualifying employment requirement, view the <strong>Forty Quarters Information</strong> tab in the <strong>IEVS Applicant Detail</strong> page for each relevant person necessary to establish eligibility. A Release of Information form is not required.</li>
    <li>For Expedited Service Cases:
      <ol>
        <li>Approve the case, if otherwise eligible, with a Postponed Verification case status (1 or 2 month certification period) if:
          <ol>
            <li>the IEVS Applicant report is not received within the required time frame, and</li>
            <li>the noncitizen has declared on the SAWS 2 Plus, CF 285, that he/she has the required 40 credits of qualified employment.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Explain to the applicant/recipient that if they do not have the required credits, any CalFresh benefits issued to which they were not eligible will be declared an overissuance and must be repaid.</li>
    <li>For all other cases, wait until the IEVS Applicant report is received, and then take action.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Forty Quarters History</h2>
  <p>The <a href="#" data-popovertext="Social Security Administration " data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">SSA</a> system will provide a Forty Quarters report through CalSAWS for those individuals for whom it was requested as part of the IEVS report. Forty Quarters History can also be requested through SAVE.</p>
  <p class="Note">Note: If the household asserts that members have 40 quarters of work history, but the SSA cannot confirm the information and is conducting an investigation to determine if additional quarters can be credited, the county must certify the household pending the results of the investigation for up to six months from the date of the original determination of insufficient quarters. A sworn statement, a legally enforceable contract, is considered sufficient temporary verification as long it is completed in front of a U.S. Notary Public or a USCIS or Consular Officer.</p>
  <h3>Lag Quarters</h3>
  <p>Depending upon when the request is submitted, the report will not contain the current and/or preceding calendar year information due to the normal processing cycle of employer-provided information. These current-year quarters and preceding-year quarters, which do not show on the report, are called Lag Quarters.</p>
  <h3>Non-covered Earnings</h3>
  <p>Non-covered earnings are earnings for which Social Security taxes were not withheld (e.g., earnings of certain public employees or earnings paid in cash). Therefore, the credits for these earnings do not appear on the report.</p>
  <p>If an applicant/recipient claims earnings from non-covered employment, the credits for those earnings can be counted if satisfactory evidence is provided. Acceptable evidence includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Taxpayer’s actual copy of W2 or W-2c forms, or</li>
    <li>A copy of the applicant’s federal or state income tax return (with a photocopy of W-2 or W-2c attached) or</li>
    <li>Employer-prepared wage statements.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Processing the Report</h3>
  <p>When the report is received, process according to this chart:</p>

  <h2>Credits of Qualifying Employment</h2>
  <h3>Federal Means-Tested Exclusion</h3>
  <p>Beginning with the first quarter of 1997, no credit of qualifying employment shall be countable if the individual who earned it received any Federal means-tested public benefits during the quarter for which it was credited.</p>
  <p>For our definition, federal means-tested public benefits include Federal CalWORKs, RCA, Medi-Cal, SSI, and the Federal food assistance program known as SNAP. The CFAP and State CalWORKs are <strong>not</strong> considered federal means-tested public benefits. However, since all individuals receiving state CalWORKs automatically receive Medi-Cal benefits, the quarters in which the individual received state CalWORKs <strong>cannot</strong> be credited due to the receipt of Medi-Cal.</p>
  <p><a class="dropspot" data-rhwidget="DropSpot" data-target="drop-down5" href="https://stgenssa.sccgov.org/debs/program_handbooks/calfresh/WIP_Ana/Draft_Eligibility_Based_on_40_Work_Quarters.htm#"><span data-open-text="true" data-skip-index="true">Example</span><span data-close-text="true">Example</span></a></p>
  <div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop-down5">
    <p>A noncitizen couple applied for themselves and their 3 citizen children in 06/00. They only had 30 QQs so were approved for CFAP for themselves and federal SNAP for their children. Due to unemployment deprivation, the family is set up on state CalWORKs. When the RV/RC is done in 06/03, the IEVS report shows 42 quarters of which 10 were earned after January 1997. The quarters they earned since 1997 are NOT countable because they received Medi-Cal along with state CalWORKs during these quarters. The parents remain ineligible for federal SNAP and will continue to receive CFAP benefits.</p>

    <p>Applicant earned $3000 in July 2000 and is credited by Social Security with 4 credits (quarters) of qualifying employment for the year. No other income is earned for the year. This individual receives Federal CalWORKs in September through December 2000. The credit for the third quarter (July through September) and fourth quarter (October through December) can NOT be counted due to the receipt of federal means tested public benefits during these quarters. However, the credit for the first quarter (January to March) and second quarter (April to June) can be counted since he/she received NO federal means tested public benefits during these quarters.</p>
  </div>
  <p>Credits for qualifying employment earned <strong>prior</strong> to 1997 count regardless of whether the individual received any federal means-tested public benefits during the quarter for which they were credited.</p>
  <p class="Note">Reminder: At every recertification, the EW must review to determine whether the individual meets the 40 qualifying quarters requirement.</p>
  <h3>Current Year - Computation of Credits of Qualifying Employment</h3>
  <p>A current year’s credit for a quarter that has ended may be used in the 40 credits of qualifying employment computation. The term “calendar quarter” means the 3 calendar month period ending with March 31st, June 30th, September 30th, and December 31st of any year. Do not count credits for calendar quarters that have not ended, even if the individual has sufficient earnings to qualify for the credit. Use the current year amount as the divisor to determine the number of credits of qualifying employment available, always rounding down the result.</p>
  <p>To determine the number of credits of qualifying employment to be counted for the current year, use the lesser of:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The number of quarters that have ended for the current year <strong>or</strong></li>
    <li>The number of credits of qualifying employment available based on total earnings divided by the amount needed per credit.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><a class="dropspot" data-rhwidget="DropSpot" data-target="drop-down8" href="https://stgenssa.sccgov.org/debs/program_handbooks/calfresh/WIP_Ana/Draft_Eligibility_Based_on_40_Work_Quarters.htm#"><span data-open-text="true" data-skip-index="true">Example</span><span data-close-text="true">Example</span></a></p>
  <div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop-down8">
    <p>An applicant applies in May 2004. He was laid off in April 2004 with year to date earnings of $4000. Based on earnings [$4000 divided by $900 (amount needed for each credit for 2004) = 4.44], he is entitled to 4 credits. Since only one quarter has ended (i.e. January through March 2004), only one of the credits can be counted for 2004.</p>
  </div>
  <h3>Establishing Credits/Quarters - 1978 through the current year</h3>
  <p>For 1978 and later, credits are based solely on the total yearly earnings. All types of earnings follow this rule. The amount of earnings needed to earn a credit increases and is different for each year. For 1978 through 2005, the amount of earnings needed for each credit is:</p>

  <h3>Establishing Credits - 1977 and earlier years</h3>
  <p>For 1977 and earlier years, an individual earned:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>One credit for each calendar quarter in which an individual was paid $50 or more in wages (including agricultural wages for 1951-1955),</li>
    <li>Four credits for each taxable year in which an individual’s net earnings from SELF-EMPLOYMENT were $400 or more and/or</li>
    <li>One credit for each $100 (limited to a total of 4 yearly) of agricultural wages paid during the year for the years from 1955 through 1977.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Combining Credits with Spouse/Parent(s)</h3>
  <p>Social Security credits (formerly called “quarters of coverage”) are earned by working at a job or as a self-employed individual.<br/>
    Each individual can only be credited with four (4) credits of qualifying employment per year based on their own employment.</p>
  <p>The individual, for CalFresh purposes, can use credits of qualifying employment earned by:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> Their current spouse (including those cohabiting and holding themselves out to the community as husband and wife by representing themselves to relatives, friends, neighbors, or tradespeople) during the spousal relationship. Refer to <a href="../Household_Composition/Definitions.html">Spouse [63-102]</a> and <a href="../Household_Composition/HHDcsn.html">HH Decision</a>.
      <ul>
        <li class="Note">
          <p class="Note">Note: Any qualifying quarters from the ex-spouse are no longer countable after the final divorce. The EW must review every recertification to determine if the individual still meets the 40 qualifying quarters requirement.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li> Their former spouse if the marriage ended by death, but only for those quarters earned during the marriage.</li>
    <li>By their natural, adopted or step parent(s) while he/she was under 18.
      <ul>
        <li>An adopted child may use the quarters of his adopted parents after the adoption and those of his birth parents prior to the adoption.</li>
        <li> The step-child can use a step-parent’s credits if the step-parent relationship still exists. The death of the step-parent does not terminate the relationship. Upon divorce, the step-parent relationship ceases to exist.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

    <p>The noncitizen “qualified” mother has the required 40 credits (12 credits of her own plus her husband’s 28 credits = 40 credits).</p>
    <p>Therefore, the noncitizen “qualified” mother is potentially eligible for Federal SNAP with the citizen husband and child. If the mother did not have the required 40 credits, then only the husband and child have receive Federal SNAP, if otherwise eligible. The noncitizen mother would be eligible for the California Food Assistance Program (CFAP). [Refer to “CFAP Requirements [63-403],” page 31-1].]</p>
