  <h1><span data-field="title" data-format="default">Good Cause for Failure to Satisfy the Work Requirement</span></h1>
  <p><a href="#" data-popovertext="Able Bodied Adult Without Dependents" data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">ABAWD</a>s subject to the time limit who would have satisfied the ABAWD work requirement, but missed some work for reasons outside of their control may be granted good cause. The individual shall be considered to have met the work requirement if the absence from work is temporary and the individual retains his or her job. Good cause is determined on a case by case basis. The month in which good cause is applied shall not be considered a countable month even though the ABAWD did not satisfy the work requirement for 80 hours for that month. Good cause may also be granted to individuals who would have satisfied the work requirement through a qualifying work activity or workfare, but did not do so for reasons outside of their control.</p>
  <p>Good cause reasons include, but is not limited to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Illness;</li>
    <li>Illness of another household member requiring the presence of the ABAWD;</li>
    <li>A household emergency;</li>
    <li>A declaration of disaster; or</li>
    <li>Lack of transportation.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="Important">Important: There is no limit on the number of months an individual can be determined to have good cause for failure to satisfy the ABAWD work requirement. However, good cause is granted on a monthly basis. Therefore, EW must verify if granting good cause is still applicable each month. When granting good cause, the EW must thoroughly document the reason for the good cause determination in the case record. Verification is not required.</p>
  <h2><a id="TimeLimit"></a>ABAWD Time Limit</h2>
  <p>The ABAWD time limit applies to individuals who are not exempt or do not meet the work requirement.</p>
  <h3>Countable Months</h3>
  <p>An ABAWD’s eligibility for CalFresh is limited to three full countable months of benefits within the 36-month period, unless the individual is exempt from the time limit, satisfying the work requirement, or living in an area with a waiver of the ABAWD time limit. Each of these three full months of benefits is referred to as a “countable month”. <a href="#" data-popovertext="Eligibility Worker" data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">EW</a>s must track an ABAWD’s use of their three countable months to correctly determine their CalFresh eligibility.</p>
  <p>Any full month during which an ABAWD subject to the time limit does not satisfy the work requirement and receives CalFresh benefits is referred to as a “countable month.” A countable month is any month in which an ABAWD, subject to the time limit, receives CalFresh benefits for the full month while not:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Satisfying the ABAWD work requirement;</li>
    <li>Being exempt from the ABAWD time limit;</li>
    <li>Living in a county or area with a waiver of the ABAWD time limit; or</li>
    <li>Receiving an exemption.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Identifying a Countable Month</h3>
  <p>A countable month is any month in which an ABAWD subject to the time limit receives CalFresh benefits for a full month while not exempt, satisfying the work requirement, or living in an area with a waiver of the ABAWD time limit.</p>
  <p>The following are not considered a countable month when the ABAWD:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Satisfies the work requirement during the month;</li>
    <li>Receives a partial/prorated month of benefits;</li>
    <li>Qualifies for an exemption for any part of the month;</li>
    <li>Lives in a waived county or area;</li>
    <li>Turns age 50 during the month; or</li>
    <li>Receives an exemption.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Tracking Countable Months</h3>
  <p>EWs must track an ABAWD’s use of their three countable months within the 36-month period. Countable months do not need to be used consecutively. An ABAWD may temporarily find sufficient employment, stop participating in CalFresh for some time, become temporarily exempt, or experience other circumstances that may cause them to use their three countable months non-consecutively.</p>
  <p>EWs track an ABAWD’s monthly CalFresh participation status using various tracking codes in CalSAWS, which indicate the ABAWD’s status as it relates to the ABAWD time limit for each month. Tracking codes are sent by the CalSAWS system to MEDS. The tracking code for a countable month is the letter “N.” For an overview of the tracking system and list of codes, Refer to <a href="TrckgABAWDPtcptn.html">ABAWD Tracking Codes</a> of this handbook.</p>
  <p>Based on information received from CalSAWS, MEDS populates an individual record of the 36-month period for each ABAWD. The MEDS record is accessible by every county statewide.</p>
  <p>If an ABAWD does not satisfy the work requirement, is not exempt, is not in receipt of an exemption and has used a countable month, CalSAWS submits the tracking code “N” to MEDS for that month. The countable month code appears in the ABAWD’s record of the 36-month period. The record remains with the individual even if they move to an area with a time limit waiver and may need to be referenced if the ABAWD moves to a different state. The record also remains with the individual if he/she becomes a member of a different CalFresh household. Only when a new 36-month period begins does an individual ABAWD get a new record of the 36-month period in MEDS and a new set of three countable months.</p>

  <p><span style="color: rgb(69, 196, 128); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;">Moving Between Waived and Non-Waived Areas within the State</span></p>
  <p>Due to regional differences in unemployment rates, certain counties or areas within counties may be waived from the ABAWD time limit. Moving between waived and non-waived areas within the 36-month period does not “restart” the three-month time limit. If an ABAWD has used any countable months during the 36-month period, those countable months will count toward the individual’s three-month time limit, regardless of the ABAWDs movement between waived and non-waived areas. That is why an individual’s record of the 36-month period remains with the individual until a new 36-month period begins.</p>
  <p>Counting months starts or stops based on the waiver eligibility of the area where the individual resides within the 36-month period. Months of benefits received while residing in a waived area do not count toward the three-month time limit. CalSAWS submits the tracking code “Z” to MEDS for months in which an ABAWD lives in a waived area.</p>
  <h2>Moving to a Waived Area</h2>
  <p>When an ABAWD moves to an area that is waived, the ABAWD is no longer subject to the time limit. The individual does not need to satisfy the work requirement or verify exemption eligibility. If the individual was previously disqualified for exhausting their three countable months, the disqualification shall be lifted and they may again receive CalFresh if otherwise eligible.</p>
  <h2>Moving to a Non-Waived Area</h2>
  <p>If an ABAWD moves from a waived to a non-waived area during the 36-month period, the ABAWD will become subject to the time limit. The individual must satisfy the work requirement the first month following the move, receive an exemption, or be otherwise exempt while residing in the non-waived area or they will be assigned a countable month for each full month of benefits received.</p>
  <h2>Tracking an ABAWD’s Movement between Waived and Non-Waived Areas</h2>
  <p>Because a countable month is a month in which an ABAWD subject to the time limit receives a full month of benefits while not exempt, satisfying the work requirement, or living in a waived area, tracking code “Z” will be used for the month an ABAWD moves between a waived and non-waived area. Tracking code “Z” indicates that the month was not countable because the ABAWD resided for part of the month in a waived area.</p>
  <p>Adjustments can be made to an individual’s calendar retroactively if it is discovered that they moved to a waived county part way through the month.</p>
  <p><a class="dropspot" data-rhwidget="DropSpot" data-target="drop-down" href="#"><span data-open-text="true" data-skip-index="true">Example</span><span data-close-text="true">Example</span></a></p>
  <div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop-down">
    <p>Tracking code “N”, which indicates a countable month, may be replaced with tracking code “Z” if an ABAWD subject to the time limit moves to a waived area part way through the month.</p>
  </div>
  <h2>Inter-County Transfer (ICT) Implications</h2>
  <p>When a household that contains a member that is an ABAWD subject to the time limit moves to a non-waived county and an <a href="#" data-popovertext="Inter-County-Transfer " data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">ICT</a> is completed, the receiving county is responsible for tracking the ABAWD the month in which the ICT is completed and moving forward (until the ABAWD moves again). The receiving county must determine the ABAWD’s status and complete the corresponding tracking whether the receiving county is a waived or non-waived area.</p>
  <p>This applies unless the receiving county is under a time limit waiver, in which case the ABAWD must be tracked (i.e. residing part of the month in a waiver county), but does not need to satisfy the work requirement the month the ICT is complete. If the individual is moving from a waived county or area, they are not required to satisfy the work requirement until the first month following the ICT.</p>
  <p>If the receiving county is a waived area the receiving county will submit tracking code “Z” to MEDS. If the receiving county is a non-waived area, the receiving county will submit a tracking code indicating the ABAWD’s status the month of the ICT and moving forward. This includes determining whether the ABAWD is satisfying the work requirement (“W”), is exempt (“E”), used a countable month (“N”), is no longer eligible for benefits, etc.</p>
  <p class="Note">Note: A full record of the ABAWD’s 36-month calendar is accessible in MEDS and must be referenced by the receiving county at the time the ICT is processed to aid in properly determining the individual’s ABAWD status.</p>
  <p class="Reminder">Reminder: Counties can retroactively apply exemptions for ICTs. If the EW of the receiving county discovers a change in ABAWD status, the EW can retroactively make the changes without contacting the sending county. The changes will also be updated in MEDS.</p>
  <h2>Use of Countable Months Out of State</h2>
  <p>A countable month may be accrued in California or in another state. If there is evidence that an individual subject to the ABAWD time limit received SNAP benefits in another state, the county must verify countable months used while residing in the other state. If the ABAWD accrued countable months during California’s current 36-month period, the county must update the client’s record in MEDS to reflect the countable months that were used in the other state. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Important: Acceptable verification from the other state agency includes a written or verbal statement (notated in the case record) or a printed image of the individual’s record of the 36-month period indicating countable months used in the other state. If necessary, the individual’s MEDS record must be updated, even if the client is residing in a time limit waiver area in California at the time of application.</p>
  <p class="Important">Important: If an ABAWD subject to the time limit was not exempt and used a countable month in another state, the county must count that month, even if the client would have been exempt had they been receiving benefits in California.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Note: The CA counties must only consider countable months that fall within the state’s 36-month period (i.e. Jan. 2017 to Dec. 2019). Any countable month used prior to September 2018 in other states must be disregarded.</p>
