  <h1><span data-field="title" data-format="default">Delayed Processing</span></h1>
  <p>An application for recertification is considered delayed any time it is processed outside of the normal timeline, which means the recertification process was not completed by the end of the final month of the certification period. When an application for recertification is processed outside of the normal timeline, delayed processing is applied to the case. An application for recertification may be delayed when submitted timely or untimely by the client, depending on the circumstances.</p>
  <h2>Timely and Untimely Application</h2>
  <p>Any application for recertification submitted on or before the 15th day of the final month of the certification period is considered timely. Any application for recertification submitted after the 15th day of the final month of the certification period is considered untimely. Many circumstances may cause a timely or untimely application for recertification to be delayed past the last day of the final month in the certification period, or potentially delayed into the 30 days following the final month of the certification period. When these circumstances occur, counties shall process timely and untimely applications for recertification using the guidance provided in this letter.</p>
  <p class="Note">Reminder: A CalFresh recertification determines a household’s eligibility for CalFresh benefits, much like an initial certification for CalFresh benefits. For all applications for recertification, including those processed outside of the normal timeline, the household’s eligibility shall be determined based on household composition at the time of the recertification interview and the last 30 days of income.</p>
  <h2>Proration of Benefits</h2>
  <p>If the recertification process is completed with the delayed processing, benefits are either prorated or issued with a full allotment of benefits, depending on the cause of the delay.</p>
  <h2><a id="CountyDelay"></a>Application Processing delays</h2>
  <p>Delays are categorized as follows: (1) County-caused delays, (2) client-caused delays, and (3) client and county-caused delays. The cause of any delay in processing an application for recertification shall be determined under this section, and benefits must be provided accordingly.</p>
  <p>In general, if the household caused the delay, benefits are prorated from the date of compliance, if county-caused the delay, benefits are provided for the full month.</p>
  <h3>County-Caused Delay</h3>
  <p>A county-caused delay refers to any time an application for recertification is processed outside of the normal timeline due to a delay in processing caused by the county. If a household files a timely application for recertification before the end of the certification period (i.e., before the 15th day), but the recertification process cannot be completed within the final month of the certification period because of a county-caused delay, the county must continue to process the case and provide a full month&#39;s benefit allotment for the first month of the new certification period as soon as administratively possible.</p>
  <h3>Client-Caused Delay</h3>
  <p>A client-caused delay refers to any time an application for recertification is processed outside of the normal timeline because of a delay caused by the client. If a household files an application for recertification before the end of the certification period, but the recertification process cannot be completed within the final month of the certification period because of a client-caused delay, the county must deny the application at the end of the certification period; this applies to an application for recertification that was filed timely or untimely.</p>
  <p>After the county denies the application, the household has up to 30 days after the end of the certification period to complete the recertification process and have its application treated as an application for recertification. If the household takes the required action after the end of the certification period, but within the 30 days following the last month of the certification period, the county shall withdraw the denial and provide prorated benefits, as soon as administratively possible, retroactive to the date the client took the required action and completed the recertification process.</p>
  <h3>Client and County-Caused Delay</h3>
  <p>A client and county-caused delay refer to any time an application for recertification is processed outside of the normal timeline because of a delay, or delays, caused by the client and the county. If a household files an application for recertification within the 30 days following the last month of the certification period, the application shall be considered an application for recertification; however, benefits must be prorated based on when the application for recertification is received. If the application for recertification is then delayed further, beyond the first month of what would have been the household’s new certification period through the fault of the county, this is considered the county-caused delay. The household’s benefits for the new certification period shall be prorated based on the date the application for recertification was received. The county shall then provide restored benefits to the household back to the date the household’s certification period should have begun had the county not erred.</p>
  <h2>Application for Recertification Received More Than 30 Days Following the End of the Certification Period</h2>
  <p>When an application for recertification is received more than 30 days following the end of the last month of the certification period, this is considered a client-caused delay and delayed processing is not permitted. However, if a complete application for recertification, such as the CF 37, is submitted more than 30 days following the end of the certification period, the county must process the CF 37 as a new application for CalFresh benefits, not as an application for recertification. The county shall not require the client to submit an additional new application for CalFresh.</p>
  <h2>Denying an Application for Recertification</h2>
  <p>When a complete application for recertification is received and the household is denied eligibility at recertification, a denial notice must be sent. Further, the Notice of Expiration of Certification form (NEC CF 377.2) does not satisfy the requirement for denying an application for recertification. The NEC form, alone, is only sufficient when an application for recertification is never submitted.</p>
  <h2>CalFresh Notice of Missed Interview (NOMI) Form at Recertification</h2>
  <p>When a household misses its initial recertification interview appointment, the county will send the household a <a href="#" data-popovertext="Notice of Missed Interview, CF 386" data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">NOMI</a> (CF 386). When this occurs, the NOMI shall be dated to reflect the end of the current certification period, even when the certification end date falls on a weekend or a holiday. The certification end date used to populate the NOMI reiterates the same date the household was notified of upon receipt of the Notice of Expiration of Certification form (CF 377.2).</p>

    <p>A household&#39;s certification period expires October 31. The household files an application for recertification on October 27 and is determined entitled to expedited service (ES). The household&#39;s next normal issuance date is November 1. As the household filed the application at least three days before its next normal issuance date, the household retains the right to uninterrupted benefits and the EW must make benefits available by November 1. Since this household filed the application before the expiration of the current certification period and there is no break in benefits, it is not necessary to record the ES application in CalSAWS.</p>

    <p>A household certification period expires October 31. The household files an application for recertification on November 1 and is determined entitled to expedited service (ES). The household&#39;s next normal issuance date is November 3. As the household did not file the application at least three days before its next normal issuance date, it has lost the right to uninterrupted benefits and the EW has until November 4 (ES processing standard date) to provide benefits. Since this household filed the application after the expiration of the current certification period, the ES application must be entered in CalSAWS.</p>
  </div>
  <h2>Benefit Extension</h2>
  <p>NEVER extend benefits beyond the end of the current certification period without processing RC.</p>
  <h2>Verification</h2>
  <p>Verification requirements for Non-Assistance households and <a href="#" data-popovertext="Categorically Eligible " data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">CE</a> households differ.</p>
  <p>Refer to <a href="../Verification/Overview.html">Verification</a> and <a href="../Verification/VrfctnReqsRcrt.html">Verification Requirements at Recertification</a>.</p>
  <p>A CalFresh household MUST be allowed at least ten (10) days to provide verification at recertification. If the household’s recertification cannot be completed by the end of its current certification period due to the 10-day time period allowed, the EW must issue benefits within 5 working days after the verification is received and the household’s benefits are NOT prorated.</p>

    <p>The recertification is due in May. The household completes the recertification interview on May 29 but needs to provide some additional verifications. The client has until June 8 to provide the verifications. If the household provides the verifications by June 8, benefits must be issued by June 15 and June benefits are NOT prorated.</p>
