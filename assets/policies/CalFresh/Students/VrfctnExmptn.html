  <h1><span data-field="title" data-format="default">Verification of Exemption</span></h1>
  <p>California elects not to require verification of exemptions for the student eligibility rule. Client statement that a student is exempt from the student eligibility rule on the application, during the interview, periodic report, recertification, or during the certification period is sufficient evidence that the student is exempt from the student eligibility rule.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Only one exemption is needed to qualify a student for CalFresh. The EW must document all exemptions being claimed in the case record. If the student loses an exemption, the EW must assess whether the student meets the criteria for another exemption before taking adverse action.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p class="Important">Important: While the student exemption is no longer a mandatory verification, income must be verified to determine the household&#39;s income eligibility for CalFresh.  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><a href="#" data-popovertext="Eligibility Worker" data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">EW</a>s must only require verification that a student meets an exemption from the student eligibility rule when:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Information provided by the household is questionable; or</li>
    <li>A student’s physical or mental unfitness claim is not evident to the EW.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="Note">Note: The <em>CalFresh Medical Certification Form</em> (CF 887) may be used to verify an individual’s physical or mental unfitness to work when it is not evident to the EW.</p>
  <h2>Questionable Exemption</h2>

  <p> </p>
  <p>The EW must document in the case record what exemption is being claimed. If a student’s statement that they meet an exemption from the student eligibility rule is questionable and verification is requested, the reason must be adequately documented in the case record as to why the information was deemed questionable, and that verification was requested.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>The following are suggested verifications for specific programs if questionable: </p>
  <h2>Approved for State or Federal Work Study</h2>
  <p>This exemption is partially based on a student being approved for work study for the current term, as defined by the institution of higher education. Acceptable verification of approval for work study may include a work study award letter from financial aid, but it is not limited to this.</p>
  <h2>Receipt of Cal Grant A or B</h2>
  <p>Verification of receipt of a Cal Grant A or B may include but is not limited to, a copy of a student’s California Aid Report, which is an award letter provided by the California Student Aid Commission and/or a printout of award confirmation from a student’s college or university web grants account.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>For purposes of verifying whether a Cal Grant A or B recipient meets two of the three TANF Cal Grant eligibility requirements outlined, including currently unmarried and 25 years of age or younger, the EW may reference existing case information.</li>
    <li>To verify whether the student meets the third requirement, parental and/or student income of $50,000 a year or less, counties should reference the student’s California Aid Report (provided by the student), which includes information regarding parental and/or student income at the time the student was deemed eligible for the Cal Grant A or B.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Participation in a Program to Increase Employability</h2>
  <p>Verification of participation in a program to increase employability may include, but is not limited to, a formal document showing participation in one of the programs listed above or a printout from a student’s college or university web-based account indicating participation in such a program.</p>
  <h2>Local Programs that Increase Employability (LPIEs) Approved by the State</h2>
  <p><a href="#" data-popovertext="Assembly Bill" data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">AB</a> 396, signed into law on October 4, 2021, requires all <a href="#" data-popovertext="California Community College " data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">CCC</a> and <a href="#" data-popovertext="California State University " data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">CSU</a> campus-based programs that meet LPIE requirements to submit an application to the CDSS on or before September 1, 2022, and requests <a href="#" data-popovertext="University of California " data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">UC</a> programs to do the same. <a href="#" data-popovertext="Senate Bill " data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">SB</a> 609, signed into law on October 6, 2021, requires CDSS to include Adult Education and <a href="#" data-popovertext="Career and Technical Education " data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">CTE</a> programs in the List of Approved LPIEs.</p>
  <h3>Process for Identifying LPIEs</h3>
  <p>Counties will no longer participate in identifying or approving campus-based LPIEs. Colleges must identify and submit their LPIE programs that contain the equivalent of an E&amp;T component. The CHC, a CalFresh outreach prime contractor out of Chico State University, will assist campuses in identifying and submitting LPIEs.</p>
  <p>CDSS updates the List of Approved LPIEs on the CDSS website on the first of each month.</p>
  <p>For the updated list, <strong></strong>EWs must refer to the CDSS Student Resources CalFresh Student Eligibility: List of Approved LPIEs<strong> </strong>website at: <a href="https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/CalFresh-resource-center/policy">https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/CalFresh-resource-center/policy</a>.</p>
  <p>The list is accessible from Program Bureau/CF Reference Materials/EW Resources/CF Student Eligibility: List of Approved Local Programs that Increase Employability.</p>
  <h3>General Programs Identified</h3>
  <p>In addition to individual LPIE program identification, the CCCs, CSUs, and UCs have identified two general programs that meet the LPIE criteria. Students from all campuses may participate in one or both of the general programs below.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Campus Employment Program</strong>: Students employed by their campus or a recognized auxiliary organization are considered to be participating in a Campus Employment Program. For LPIE purposes, an auxiliary organization must be overseen by the CCC, CSU, or UC and must serve the institution of higher education. Students enrolled in this program do not need to work an average of 20 hours per week or 80 hours per month to meet the criteria for an exemption to the student eligibility rule, as LPIEs do not have a minimum hour requirement.</li>
    <li><strong>Research and Teaching Assistantship Program</strong>: Students hired for a research or teaching assistant position, whether paid or unpaid or part of a training program, are considered to be participating in a Research and Teaching Assistantship Program.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Based on available student data, students may be notified by their campus of their enrollment in one of the above programs.</p>
  <h3>Removal of LPIEs at Private Institutions</h3>
  <p>Federal regulation requires that an LPIE be operated by a state or local government. Due to this requirement, previously approved programs that are not operated by a CCC, CSU, or UC are removed from the List of Approved LPIEs effective September 1, 2022.</p>
  <p>Students receiving CalFresh due to being enrolled in a private school LPIE must remain exempt from the student eligibility rule for the length of the certification period. Student eligibility status must be reassessed during the student’s next recertification. At that time, the EW must evaluate the student’s circumstances to determine if they meet another exemption before determining whether the student is ineligible.</p>
  <h3>Verification of  LPIE</h3>
  <p>To the greatest extent possible, students enrolled in an LPIE will be notified by their campus that they meet the criteria for an exemption from the student eligibility rule. If a student states, verbally or in writing, that they are enrolled in one of the programs listed on the List of Approved LPIEs, that is sufficient information for the County to exempt the student unless it is questionable. If the information provided by a student is questionable, acceptable verification can include but is not limited to a transcript, an email from an instructor, or verbal affirmation from a campus official. Additionally, targeted outreach emails from campuses to LPIE enrollees are acceptable verification. If a program does not appear on the Approved LPIE List, the county must explore if the student is enrolled in another LPIE or meets the criteria for another exemption before determining the student to be ineligible.</p>
