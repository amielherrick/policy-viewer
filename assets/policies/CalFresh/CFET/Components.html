  <h1><span data-field="title" data-format="default">CFET Components</span></h1>
  <p>CFET refers to the following services, activities, or programs as components of the CFET program. A CFET program must include at least one component, but may also provide a sequence of components or concurrent components.</p>
  <h2>Non-Education, Non-Work Components</h2>
  <h3>Supervised Job Search</h3>
  <p>Activities under the Supervised Job Search component include, but are not limited to:</p>
  <h4>Supervised Job Search</h4>
  <p>Supervised Job Search requires participants to make inquiries to prospective employers. Participants may do this; on their own, with one-on-one assistance, or in a group setting. It is considered a legitimate job search contact when the participant submits a resume or application to an employer or has an interview with a potential employer. The job contact must be in an area of work for which the participant is reasonably qualified. Job search components should entail approximately 12 contacts with employers per month.</p>
  <h4>Job Search Training</h4>
  <p>Enhances the job readiness of participants by teaching job seeking techniques, increasing job search motivation and boosting self-confidence. This component includes but is not limited to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Occupational assessment,</li>
    <li>Remedial and entry-level job skills training,</li>
    <li>Online Job Search Tools,</li>
    <li>Resume building,</li>
    <li>Interview skills coaching,</li>
    <li>Customized and institutional skill training,</li>
    <li>Self-improvement training,</li>
    <li>Job Club, and/or</li>
    <li>Job Placement Services.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Job Retention</h3>
  <p>Services are provided to individuals who have secured employment to help them achieve satisfactory performance, retain employment, and increase earnings over time. Such services and reimbursable participant costs may include but are not limited to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Case management,</li>
    <li>Life skill classes,</li>
    <li>Referrals to other services,</li>
    <li>Dependent care assistance,</li>
    <li>Transportation assistance,</li>
    <li>Clothing required for the job,</li>
    <li>Equipment or tools required for the job,</li>
    <li>Test fees,</li>
    <li>Union dues, and/or</li>
    <li>Licensing and bonding fees.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="Note">Note: Job Retention services are available to the participant for a minimum of 30 days and a maximum of 90 days from the date of employment, even if CF benefits have been discontinued.</p>
  <h2>Education Components</h2>
  <p>Education activities are programs that have a direct link to the local job market for participants who cannot gain employment due to basic skills deficits or lack of a high school diploma.</p>
  <p class="Note">Reminder: Federal E&amp;T funds cannot take the place of non-federal (i.e., State, local) funds for existing educational services. Federal financial participation for operating education components may be authorized only for costs that exceed the normal cost of services provided to persons not participating in E&amp;T.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Allowable educational programs may include:</p>
  <p><strong>Career and Technical Education </strong></p>
  <p>Are designed to improve the employability of participants by providing training in a skill or trade for careers in current or emerging employment sectors, typically provided by training institutions that provide an industry-recognized certificate or credential.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><strong>Adult Basic Education</strong></p>
  <p>Programs that offer academic instruction and education services that increase an individual&#39;s ability to read, write, and speak in English and perform mathematics or other activities necessary for the attainment of a high school diploma or its recognized equivalent; transition to post secondary education and training; and obtain employment. Such programs include <a href="#" data-popovertext="Adult Basic Education " data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">ABE</a>, basic literacy, and high school equivalency (GED, TASC, HiSET, or other).</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><strong>English Language Acquisition</strong></p>
  <p>A component designed to help English language learners achieve competence in reading, writing, speaking, and comprehension of the English language.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><strong>Integrated Education Training</strong></p>
  <p>A service approach that provides adult education and literacy activities concurrently and contextually with workforce preparation activities and workforce training for a specific occupation or occupational cluster for the purpose of educational and career advancement. An <a href="#" data-popovertext="Integrated Education Training" data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">IET</a> program must include the following three components: adult education and literacy activities, workforce preparation activities, and workforce training.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><strong>Work Readiness Training</strong></p>
  <p>Training for both foundational cognitive skills such as reading for information, applied mathematics, locating information, problem solving, and critical thinking and non-cognitive skills (or soft skills), which are defined as personal characteristics and behavioral skills that enhance an individual&#39;s interactions, job performance, and career prospects such as adaptability, integrity, cooperation, and workplace discipline.</p>
  <h2>Work Components</h2>
  <h3>Workfare</h3>
  <p>Workfare participants work off the value of their household&#39;s monthly benefit allotment through an assignment at a private or public non-profit agency as a condition of eligibility. In lieu of wages, workfare participants receive compensation in the form of their household&#39;s monthly benefit allotment. The primary goal of workfare is to improve employability and encourage individuals to move into regular employment while returning something of value to the community. Workfare assignments cannot replace or prevent the employment of regular employees. Workfare assignments must provide the same working conditions and workers&#39; compensation benefits that are provided to regularly employed individuals performing similar work for equal hours.</p>
  <h3>Work Experience</h3>
  <p>A work experience program is designed to improve the employability of household members through actual work experience or training, or both, and to enable individuals employed or trained under such programs to move promptly into regular public or private employment. Work experience is a planned, structured learning experience that takes place in a workplace for a limited period. Work experience may be paid or unpaid, as appropriate, and consistent with other laws such as the Fair Labor Standards Act. Work experience may be arranged within the private for-profit sector, the non-profit sector, or the public sector. Labor standards apply in any work experience setting where an employee/employer relationship, as defined by the Fair Labor Standards Act, exists.</p>
  <p>A work experience program must:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Not provide any work that has the effect of replacing the employment of an individual not participating in the employment or training experience program; and</li>
    <li>Provide the same benefits and working conditions that are provided at the job site to employees performing comparable work for comparable hours.</li>
    <li>A work experience program may include either a Work Activity or a Work-Based Learning program. Both Work Activities and Work-Based Learning opportunities must involve a planned and structured learning experience.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Work Activity</h4>
  <p>A Work Activity is performed in exchange for CalFresh benefits that provides an individual with an opportunity to acquire the general skills, knowledge, and work habits necessary to obtain employment.</p>
  <p>The purpose of work activity is to improve the employability of those who cannot find unsubsidized full-time employment.<br/>
    Work Activity must be designed to improve the employability of CalFresh E&amp;T participants through actual work experience and/or training, and enable individuals employed or trained under such programs to move promptly into regular public or private employment.</p>
  <h4>Work-Based Learning</h4>
  <p>A Work-Based Learning program in CFET is a sustained interaction with industry or community professionals in real world settings to the extent practicable, or simulated environments at an educational institution that foster in-depth, firsthand engagement with the tasks required in each career field, that are aligned to curriculum and instruction. Work-Based Learning emphasizes employer engagement, includes specific training objectives, and leads to regular employment. Work-Based Learning can include Subsidized Employment, Work Experience, Pre-apprenticeship, Apprenticeship, On-the-Job Training, and Internships. Work-Based Learning can also include both subsidized and unsubsidized employment models whereby employment &amp; training funds are used to subsidize the participant&#39;s wage.</p>
  <h3>Subsidized Employment</h3>
  <p>Subsidized Employment can be performed at any private or public employer with a standing agreement from the CFET provider. </p>
  <p>Participants must be paid an amount equal to at least the local or state minimum wage for all hours of participation. Wages paid to CFET participants via Subsidized Employment are reimbursable at the rate of 50 percent. Subsidized Employment wages are countable income against CalFresh benefits; therefore, participants should be informed prior to engaging in Subsidized Employment. A plan must be in place to move Subsidized Employment participants into unsubsidized employment swiftly, either with the same employer or a different employer.</p>
  <h3>Work Experience</h3>
  <p>The goal of this component is to gain the experience necessary to obtain employment and enable participants to move into regular employment. Whereas participants earn wages via Subsidized Employment, participants in Work Experience do not earn wages.</p>
  <h3>Apprenticeships</h3>
  <p>Apprenticeships allow participants to work with sponsoring organizations to earn necessary credentialing for industry-specific jobs. Participants combine on-the-job training with a practical and theoretical learning environment to gain highly skilled occupations directly linked to an apprenticeship program. These programs can be sponsored by individual employers, joint employer and labor groups, and/or employer associations.</p>
  <h3>Pre-Apprenticeships</h3>
  <p>Pre-apprenticeship services and programs are designed to prepare individuals to enter and succeed in registered Apprenticeship programs. These programs have a documented partnership with at least one registered Apprenticeship program sponsor and together, they expand the participant&#39;s career pathway opportunities with industry-based training coupled with classroom instruction.</p>
  <h3>On-the-Job Training</h3>
  <p><a href="#" data-popovertext="On-the-Job Training " data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">OJT</a> is a training provided by an employer to a participant, who receives compensation while engaged in productive work that:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Provides knowledge or skills essential to the full and adequate performance of the occupation,</li>
    <li>Provides reimbursement to the employer for the costs of providing the training and additional supervision related to the training, and</li>
    <li>Is limited in duration as appropriate to the occupation for which the participant is being trained.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Work placement can be made through a contract with an employer or registered program sponsor in the public, private nonprofit, or private sector. An OJT contract must be limited to the time required for a participant to become proficient in the occupation for which the training is being provided. In determining the appropriate length of the contract, consideration should be given to the skill requirements of the occupation, the academic and occupational skill level of the participant, prior work experience, and the participant&#39;s individual employment plan.</p>
  <h3>Internships</h3>
  <p>Internships are a planned, structured learning experience that takes place in a workplace for a limited period of time. The exact duration will be set as appropriate for the participant&#39;s employment goals, background and skill level as reflected in the individual employment plan. They may be paid or unpaid, as appropriate and consistent with other laws such as the Fair Labor Standards Act.</p>
