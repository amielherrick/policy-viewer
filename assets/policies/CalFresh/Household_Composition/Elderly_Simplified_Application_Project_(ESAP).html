  <h2>ESAP Households</h2>
  <p>CalFresh applicant and recipient households are eligible for the ESAP if all household members are elderly (age 60 or older) and/or disabled and have no earned income. If the household includes excluded or ineligible members who are also all elderly and/or disabled, the household is still eligible for the ESAP.</p>
  <p>The four waivers described below were approved as part of California’s ESAP:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Waive the recertification interview requirement for E/D households that ESAP eligibility has been established;</li>
    <li>Must use available data matching to reduce client-provided verifications;</li>
    <li>Extend the certification period to 36 months, for E/D households with no earned income, including for ESAP cases processed by the Social Security Administration (SSA); and</li>
    <li>Elimination of requiring a SAR 7 Eligibility Status Report (effective March 2022).</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Certification Periods</h2>
  <p>The certification period for ESAP households has been extended to 36 months.</p>
  <h2>Interviews for Applicants and Non-ESAP Households</h2>
  <p>An interview for the applicant and ongoing households is required at initial certification and recertification to determine eligibility for ESAP. During the initial certification interview or the recertification interview, EWs must inform the household that an interview will not be required at the household’s next recertification unless:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The household requests an interview;</li>
    <li>The County is going to deny the household’s recertification application (e.g., a household’s circumstances have changed and they appear to be ineligible for CalFresh); or</li>
    <li>The information supplied by the household or authorized representative is questionable, incomplete, or contradictory.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If a CalFresh household was previously ineligible for ESAP but appears ESAP eligible based on the information provided on the application for recertification (e.g., all household members age and become elderly), the EW must conduct a recertification interview to establish ESAP eligibility moving forward. A recertification interview cannot be waived until after ESAP eligibility has been established.</p>
  <h2>Interview for Ongoing ESAP Households</h2>
  <p>An interview at recertification is not required for ESAP households. However, if at recertification it appears that an ESAP household will no longer be eligible for CalFresh based on the information provided on the application for recertification or other information available to the County, the EW must attempt to schedule an interview.</p>
  <p class="Important">Important: No case will be denied at recertification without an attempt to schedule an interview.</p>
  <h2>Verifications</h2>
  <p>Under the ESAP waiver, electronic matches must be used to verify identity, income, residency, non-citizen eligibility, utility expenses, Medicare premium, child support payments, and social security numbers. If the electronic data match is not available or the information is questionable, the verification is requested from the household.</p>
  <p class="Note"><span style="font-weight:bold;">Note</span>: Medical expenses can only be verified through electronic data matches if the household pays a Medicare premium. If the household does not pay a Medicare premium, medical expenses are verified with documentary evidence or collateral contacts. If the household cannot verify medical expenses, the application should not be denied, but the medical expense deduction is not be applied. Most ESAP households with verified medical expenses over $35 per month qualify for the <a href="#" data-popovertext="Standard Medical Deduction " data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">SMD</a>.</p>
  <h2>Action Required During the Certification Period</h2>
  <p>During the certification period, the EW must take action upon receipt of a <a href="#" data-popovertext="deceased persons match " data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">DPM</a> and the <a href="#" data-popovertext="Nationwide prisoner match " data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">NPM</a>.</p>
  <p>Refer to <a href="https://stgenssa.sccgov.org/debs/program_handbooks/ievs_bp/assets/01IEVS_Business_Processes/Jail_Prison_Matches.htm">Matches Received by SIU</a> topic in the IEVS Business Process Handbook, for processing instructions.</p>
  <h2>Elimination of Periodic Reporting Requirement</h2>
  <p>As of March 2022, ESAP households are no longer be required to complete a SAR 7 at the 12th and 24th month of their 36-month certification period. While the periodic reporting requirement no longer applies, ESAP households will continue to be categorized as semi-annual reporting (SAR) households and must complete applicable mandatory mid-period reporting requirements, including gross monthly income received over the Income Reporting Threshold (IRT), and recertification reporting requirements at the end of the certification period (excluding the interview as allowed under the ESAP) to maintain benefit eligibility. While ESAP households will no longer be required to complete a SAR 7, they will continue to receive a <em>Reporting Changes for Cash Aid and CalFresh</em> (SAR 2) form at the 12th and 24th month of their 36-month certification period. The SAR 2 reminds ESAP households of the requirement to report gross monthly income received over the IRT during the 36-month certification period, if applicable. </p>
  <h2>Conversion from ESAP to Non-ESAP</h2>
  <p>If an ESAP household becomes ineligible for the ESAP but remains eligible for CalFresh during the certification period, the County must convert the ESAP household to a regular CalFresh household. At the time of conversion, the household is no longer be covered by the ESAP waivers except for the 36 month certification period and will be subject to regular reporting requirements. To maintain eligibility, households converted from ESAP to non-ESAP must comply with all reporting requirements, including submission of a SAR 7 at 6, 12, and 24 months as applicable, depending on the reason for the conversion (e.g., a household composition change or employment), for the remainder of the 36-month certification period.</p>
  <p>When an ESAP household is converted from ESAP to a regular CalFresh household, the CalFresh Notice of Status Change for Households with only Elderly and/or Disabled Members (CF 377.2D) must be sent to inform the household of reporting responsibilities (e.g., interview required at recertification and periodic reporting).</p>
  <p>Households that become ineligible for ESAP must complete their 36-month certification period. The County cannot shorten a household’s certification period once assigned. At the end of the 36-month certification period, the EW must determine the household’s continuing CalFresh eligibility and determine whether the household continues to be ineligible for ESAP. If ineligible for ESAP, the EW assigns the household to a shorter certification period based on household type. The length of the new certification period will be 12 or 24 months, depending on why the household is no longer eligible for ESAP. If the household is determined to be ESAP eligible once again, the household must again be assigned a 36-month certification period.</p>
  <h2>ESAP Noticing Requirements</h2>
  <p>The following notices are required to be sent to ESAP households:</p>
  <h3>CF 377.2B: Notice of Expiration of Certification (NEC) Period</h3>
  <p>This notice must be sent out to ESAP eligible households in the month before the end of the 36-months. The notice informs the household that:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The current certification period will end;</li>
    <li>The household must complete the application and return it to the county by the designated due date; and</li>
    <li>A recertification interview is not required;</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>CF 377.2C: CalFresh Notice of Expiration of Certification for Households with only Elderly and/or Disabled members</h3>
  <p>This notice must be sent to households determined to be eligible for ESAP at application or recertification, but they are no longer eligible due to a change during the certification period. The notice informs the household that:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>CalFresh Certification period will end on the date indicated;</li>
    <li>A recertification interview is now required.</li>
    <li>The household or AR has the right to apply for CalFresh at any Social Security Administration office If the household consists only of <a href="#" data-popovertext="Supplemental Security Income " data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">SSI</a> members.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>CF 377.2D: CalFresh Notice of Status Change for Households with Only elderly and/or Disabled Members</h3>
  <p>This notice is sent to an ESAP household when it is removed from the ESAP status and is converted to a regular CalFresh household. The CF 377.2D informs the household of non-ESAP status and new reporting responsibilities.</p>
