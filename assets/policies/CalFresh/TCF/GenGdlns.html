  <h1><span data-field="title" data-format="default">General TCF Guidelines</span></h1>
  <p>The maximum <a href="#" data-popovertext="Transitional CalFresh" data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">TCF</a> benefit period is five months. TCF benefits cannot be issued beyond the five-month period. The TCF period begins on the first of the month following the CalWORKs discontinuance or implementation of a state administrative hearing decision discontinuing CalWORKs. At any time during the five-month transitional period, the TCF household may apply for regular CalFresh benefits by completing the CalFresh recertification process.</p>
  <h2>TCF Noticing Requirements</h2>
  <p>Once TCF eligibility is established, the CalFresh Notice of Approval/Termination Transitional Benefits (CF 1239) form must be sent to the household. The CF 1239 notifies the household of their TCF eligibility and that they must be recertified to continue receiving CalFresh benefits after the five-month transitional period.</p>
  <p>The CF 1239 informs households of the following information:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A change to their CalFresh benefit amount is due to the loss of the CalWORKs grant.</li>
    <li>Households receiving Transitional CalFresh benefits are not required to report or provide verification for any household changes until the end of the Transitional CalFresh period or recertification.</li>
    <li>The County will not act on household changes that they report during the 5-month Transitional CalFresh period. However, they are encouraged to tell the county if you change your address.</li>
    <li>If households have a decrease in income, an increase in expenses, or a change in household size before the end of the 5-month Transitional CalFresh period, they may recertify early because their CalFresh benefits may increase.</li>
    <li>Households may ask to recertify for regular CalFresh at any time during the Transitional CalFresh period. If they ask to recertify during the first four months of the Transitional CalFresh period, their regular CalFresh benefits may be lower than the current Transitional CalFresh amount. They may withdraw their request to recertify if they believe that their benefits will go down.</li>
    <li>If households do not recertify during the Transitional CalFresh period, they will receive a notice when it is time to recertify.</li>
    <li>If households apply and are approved for CalWORKs during the Transitional CalFresh period, they must recertify for CalFresh. Transitional CalFresh will end when the CalWORKs or regular CalFresh benefits are approved, even if their five months have not ended. Those households will have a new CalFresh certification period.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Benefit Calculation</h2>
  <p>The TCF allotment is calculated by deducting the CalWORKs grant from the CalFresh budget that was used in the final month that the household received CalWORKs. Additional income that may have resulted in the discontinuance of the <a href="#" data-popovertext="Public Assistance " data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">PA</a> CalFresh case or household change is NOT added in. The TCF benefit allotment is determined based on information already available to the County.</p>
  <p>In a situation where CalWORKs benefits should have been discontinued but the client continued to receive a CalWORKs grant, Transitional CalFresh benefits will begin the month after the last month the client received a CalWORKs grant.</p>
  <p><a class="dropspot" data-rhwidget="DropSpot" data-target="drop-down" href="#"><span data-open-text="true" data-skip-index="true">Example</span><span data-close-text="true">Example</span></a></p>
  <p>A client has earned income of $1450 per month and receives $226 in CalWORKs, $170 in CalFresh for herself and her three children for 01/04. Her earnings increase to $2000 per month, beginning in 02/04, making the AU/CalFresh HH ineligible for CalWORKs and regular CalFresh benefits. The case is discontinued 01/31/04. The 02/04 Transitional CalFresh budget is calculated using the same income and deductions as in the 01/04 CalFresh budget minus the CalWORKs grant. The Transitional CalFresh benefits for 02/04 will be $272.</p>

  </table>
  <h3>Loss of Categorical Eligibility (CE) Status</h3>
  <p>The loss of <a href="#" data-popovertext="Categorically Eligible " data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">CE</a> status can not be acted upon in establishing eligibility or benefit entitlement for Transitional CalFresh.</p>
  <p>When a CalWORKs household is receiving a zero CalWORKs cash grant at the time they are discontinued from CalWORKs and is receiving $10 in CalFresh benefits because of <a href="#" data-popovertext="Categorically Eligible " data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">CE</a> status, the household is entitled to receive the same amount ($10) of CalFresh benefits for the Transitional CalFresh period. The fact that the household is no longer CE eligible can not be taken into consideration.</p>
  <h2>Household Changes</h2>
  <p>Households are NOT required to report changes in their circumstances during the transitional period. SAR 7 reports will NOT be generated or required on Transitional CalFresh cases.</p>
  <p>Once Transitional CalFresh benefits are established, they remain the same for the duration of the Transitional CalFresh period, regardless of changes, except if the:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Household requests discontinuance of Transitional CalFresh in writing,</li>
    <li>The household OR members of the household are approved for CalWORKs (<a href="#" data-popovertext="Temporary Assistance for Needy Families " data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">TANF</a>) and/or regular CalFresh benefits in another case, county or state.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Any other information received shall not be acted on.This includes information received from a third party. If it appears a reported change would increase the amount of CalFresh benefits to which the household would be entitled, the CalFresh HH should be advised that they have the right to request termination of Transitional CalFresh benefits and to reapply for regular CalFresh benefits.</p>
  <p><a class="dropspot" data-rhwidget="DropSpot" data-target="drop-down1" href="#"><span data-open-text="true" data-skip-index="true">Example</span><span data-close-text="true">Example</span></a></p>
  <div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop-down1">
    <p>CalWORKs case is discontinued effective 12/31/03, due to an increase in earnings. On 03/14/04, the client calls to report that three of her children, who were in foster care, have been returned to her. The Transitional CalFresh benefits amount would remain unchanged. The client would be advised she has the right to reapply for regular CalFresh benefits.</p>
  </div>
  <h3>Removing Members During TCF Period</h3>
  <p><a href="#" data-popovertext="Transitional CalFresh" data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">TCF</a> household member(s) must be removed and TCF benefits for that member(s) must be discontinued during the TCF period If a TCF household member(s) is:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Approved for CalFresh or CalWORKs on a separate case.</li>
    <li>Moved out of state during the TCF period and are approved for SNAP and/or TANF in their new state of residence.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="Note">Note: TCF households or individual household members who move out of state must not be discontinued from TCF unless they have also been approved for SNAP or TANF out of state; otherwise, TCF will continue to be issued.</p>
  <p>When this happens, the county must recalculate the TCF benefit allotment for the remaining TCF household members by removing the individual(s) from the household along with their income, resources, and contribution to household deductions, if any.</p>
  <p>If the entire household requests to cease receiving TCF benefits, the County must close the TCF case. A timely notice is not required if the household requested in writing or in the presence of the EW.</p>
  <h3>Address Changes</h3>
  <p>When the household moves:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Within the county, the household’s address should be changed to the new address. Shelter costs are NOT changed during the Transitional CalFresh period.</li>
    <li>Outside of the county, Santa Clara County continues to issue Transitional CalFresh until the end of the Transitional CalFresh period.
      <ul>
        <li>If the client applies for CalWORKs in the new county, Santa Clara County will discontinue Transitional CalFresh with 10-day notice after the CalWORKs grant has been approved.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Out of State, the Transitional CalFresh case is not discontinued during the Transitional CalFresh period. The only instance in which Transitional CalFresh can be terminated is when the County learns that the household has been approved for TANF/CalWORKs or <a href="#" data-popovertext="Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program" data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">SNAP</a> out of state.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="Note">Note: The EBT “Out of State Usage Report” does not constitute CalFresh benefit discontinuance.</p>
