  <p>Add a new member to the household effective the first of the month following the month when the new member was first reported, providing that the new member is eligible and all the required forms and verifications are received.</p>
  <p>Use the following chart to determine when and how to add a new member to a <a href="#" data-popovertext="Semi-Annual Reporting " data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">SAR</a> household:</p>
  <h2>Steps to Add a Person to a SAR Household</h2>
  <h3>VOLUNTARY MID-PERIOD REPORT</h3>
  <p>Follow these steps when a SAR household makes a voluntary Mid-Period report that someone new moved into the home.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Determine whether the new person is a household member. Are they:
      <ol>
        <li>Related to anyone in the household (parent, child)?</li>
        <li>Purchasing or preparing meals with other household members?</li>
        <li>A minor under parental control of a household member?
          <ol>
            <li>If YES, the new person is a household member. Go to Step # 2.</li>
            <li>If NO, the new person is not a household member. Document this on the Maintain Case Comments window and STOP HERE.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Determine whether the new income combined with the new household&#39;s current income exceeds the IRT, or uncertain. If Yes, follow the steps below. If NO, go to Step #3.
      <ol>
        <li>Send a <a href="#" data-popovertext="Request for Contact " data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">RFC</a> form CF 32 requesting all required verification for the new member and their income and document the case record.</li>
        <li>If the RFC is returned complete and their income is below IRT, add the new member and their income to the household effective the first of the month following the month when the new member was reported.</li>
        <li>If the household’s income exceeds the IRT for the new household size, the household is ineligible and must be terminated with a 10-day NOA.</li>
        <li>If information and verification needed to add the new member is not provided or incomplete, discontinue the household for failing to respond to the RFC and issue a CF 377.4 SAR.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>If the new mandatory member does not have income or their new income does not exceed the IRT,
      <ol>
        <li>Inform the household on the CF 377.6 of the action necessary to add the new member and note such action in the case record.</li>
        <li>If the household responds with all needed verifications, add the new member and their income and adjust benefits effective the following month.</li>
        <li>If the household does not respond, send a “No Change NOA” to the household informing them that the voluntary report of the new household member did not increase benefits. The household must be reminded that the change must be reported on the next SAR 7 or recertification, along with the required verification.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Determine what forms, if any, are required to add the new member
      <ol>
        <li>If the household is <a href="#" data-popovertext="Categorically Eligible " data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">CE</a>, then use the following forms:
          <ol>
            <li>CW 8A; or</li>
            <li>CW 8; or</li>
            <li>SAWS 2 Plus.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>If the household is <a href="#" data-popovertext="nonassistance" data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">NA</a>, then an application form is not required, but any of the forms listed above or a CF 285 may be used.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>For NA households, this may be done by phone, using the SAR 7/RC forms, or by appointment with an application. If a new application is not taken, document the new member&#39;s information on, and sign and date, either of the:
      <ol>
        <li>County Use Section of the last “Application for CalFresh Benefits&quot; (CF 285) on file OR “Maintain Case Comments window.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>For CE households, schedule an appointment to review the application forms.</li>
    <li>Review the following eligibility factors for the new member:
      <ol>
        <li>Citizenship/non-citizenship status</li>
        <li>Income</li>
        <li>Resources</li>
        <li>Voluntary quit and work registration requirements</li>
        <li>Obtain the following for the new member:</li>
        <li>SSN or MC 194.</li>
        <li>Income verification, if applicable.</li>
        <li>Work registration, if applicable.</li>
        <li>Non-citizenship status verification, if applicable.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>If the new member is ineligible, take no action. Send a NO change NOA reminding the household to report the change on their next SAR 7 or RC.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>SAR 7 REPORT</h3>
  <p>Follow these steps when a SAR Household reports someone new moved into the home in a month prior to the Submit Month on their SAR </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Determine whether the new person is a household member. Are they:
      <ol>
        <li>Related to anyone in the household (parent, child)?</li>
        <li>Purchasing or preparing meals with other household members?</li>
        <li>A minor under parental control of a household member?
          <ol>
            <li>If YES, the new person is a household member. Go to step 2 on page 13-2.</li>
            <li>If NO, the new person is not a household member. Document this on the Maintain Case Comments window and STOP HERE.</li>

            <li>CW 8; or</li>
            <li>SAWS 2 Plus.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>If the household is NA, then an application form is not required, but any of the forms listed above or a CF 285 may be used.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Determine eligibility for the new member when the household reported the new member.

  </div>
  <h2>Previously Excluded Member</h2>
  <p>To add a previously excluded member to the household, determine prospective eligibility. Budget the previously excluded members income and expenses prospectively.</p>
  <h2>Discontinued HHs</h2>
  <h3>Break of One Day or More</h3>
  <p>When a household reapplies for benefits after a break of one day or more, and a new member has joined the household:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The regulations for adding a person do not apply.</li>
    <li>Follow the regulations for new applicant households and issue benefits for all household members (including the new member) effective the date of application, if eligibility is determined within the application processing timeframes. Refer to <a href="../Application/AppForms.html">Application</a>.</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop-down9">
    <p>A mother and three children were discontinued from CalFresh on 11/30 for failure to submit October’s SAR 7. They reapply on 12/5 and report that the father returned home on 11/3. If eligibility is determined timely, benefits for all household members, including the father, will be paid effective 12/5.</p>

  <h2>Household Reports New Member After the Extended Filing Date</h2>
  <p>Follow these steps to add someone new to the household when the household failed to report the new member until after the extended filing date for the SAR Submit month when the new member should have been reported.</p>

  <div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop-down10">
    <p>SAR Payment Period: February through July</p>
    <p>At the RC on January 7th, a household reports that a new member moved in on June 10th. July is the submit month for changes which occurred since the household submitted their last SAR 7. The extended filing date is the first working day in August. Since the household did not report the new member until after that date, use the steps below when adding the new member.</p>
  </div>
  <ol>
    <li>Determine whether the new person should have been a household member. Begin with the first month when the new member could have been added if the household had reported them in the home in a timely manner on the SAR 7. (In the example above, the new member would have been added August 1st if the household had reported the member on the June SAR 7, as required.) Determine for each month, up through the current month, whether the new member was/is:
      <ol>
        <li>Related to anyone in the household (parent, child)?</li>
        <li>Purchasing or preparing meals with other household members?</li>
        <li>A minor under parental control of a household member?
          <ol>
            <li>If YES, the new person is a household member. Go to STEP 2.</li>
            <li>If NO, the new person is not a household member. Document this on the Maintain Case Comments window and STOP HERE.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Determine what forms, if any, are required to add the new members
      <ol>
        <li>If the household is CE, then use the following forms:
          <ol>
            <li>CW 8A; or</li>
            <li>CW 8; or</li>
            <li>SAWS 2 Plus.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>If the household is NA, then an application form is not required, but any of the forms listed above or a CF 285 may be used.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Determine eligibility for the new member when the household reported the new member.
      <ol>
        <li>For NA households, this may be done by phone, using the SAR 7, or by appointment with an application. If a new application is not taken, document the new member&#39;s information on, and sign and date, either of the:
          <ol>
            <li>County Use Section of the “Application for CalFresh Benefits (CF 285) <br/>
              OR</li>
            <li><em>Maintain Case Comments </em>window</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>For CE households, schedule an appointment to review the application forms.</li>
        <li>Review the following eligibility factors for the new member:
          <ol>
            <li>Citizenship/non-citizenship status</li>
            <li>Income</li>
            <li>Resources</li>
            <li>Voluntary quit and work registration requirements</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Obtain the following for the new member:
          <ol>
            <li>SSN or MC 194.</li>
            <li>Income verification, if applicable.</li>
            <li>Work registration, if applicable.</li>
            <li>Non-citizen status verification, if applicable.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>If information and verification needed to add the new member is not provided:
      <ol>
        <li>Send a “Verification Checklist” or DFA 387 notice requesting the household to provide the information/verification within 10 days. At the end of the 10-day period, if the requested information/verification is not received, a 10-day NOA must be issued to discontinue the household for Failure to Provide Information.</li>
        <li><a class="dropspot" data-rhwidget="DropSpot" data-target="drop-down11" href="#"><span data-open-text="true" data-skip-index="true">Example</span><span data-close-text="true">Example</span></a>

        <li>DO NOT issue lost benefits for prior months.</li>
        <li>Establish an overissuance claim to recover any overissuance resulting from the unreported addition of the new household member.</li>
