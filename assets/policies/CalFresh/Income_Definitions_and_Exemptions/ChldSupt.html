  <h1><span data-field="title" data-format="default">Child Support Payments</span></h1>
  <p>[63-502(p)]</p>
  <p>Legally obligated child support payments (including arrearages) that a household member pays to or for an individual living outside of the household are excluded as income by allowing them as a deduction. The child support exclusion/deduction is first deducted from the unearned income and any remainder is deducted from the earned income, with the 20% earned income deduction taken prior to the child support exclusion. In addition, if all or part of the UIB/DIB payment is withheld to pay owed child support, the child support amount being withheld is allowed as a deduction in the budget.</p>
  <p class="Note">Note: If the obligator has zero income but the child support is paid by another household member or by the CalWORKs/Tribal TANF grant, the child support payment is excluded from the household’s income.</p>
  <p>Child support payments made to a third party (i.e. a landlord or utility company) on behalf of a the non-household member in accordance with the support order are to be included in the child support exclusion. Payments made by a household with a legal obligation to obtain health care insurance for a child are also to be included as part of the child support exclusion.</p>
  <p class="Note">Important: If the child support payment is deducted from wages on a bi-weekly or weekly basis, do not apply the multipliers to child support paid. The actual paid amount (not to exceed the court ordered amount) that is used to compute benefits.</p>
  <p class="Note">However, the multipliers can be used for child support payments received weekly or bi-weekly as it is treated as unearned income, not an income exclusion.</p>
  <p>Refer to <a href="../Budgeting_Concepts/ChldSpptDsrgd.html#ChldSupPaid">Child Support Paid</a> for budgeting information.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p class="Note">Note: Spousal support payments are not excluded from the CalFresh income, regardless if they are a legal obligation for the CalFresh household.</p>
  <h2>Child Support Arrearages</h2>
  <p>Child support arrearages being paid by a household member for children who are now in the home with the household member are excluded as income if the following conditions are met:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The responsible parent whose child is back in the home is making the payments OUTSIDE the home (e.g., local child support agency), <br/>
      AND</li>
    <li>The outstanding amount remains a legal obligation.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If the arrearages are forwarded (e.g, by local child support agency) to someone living in the home, the funds received are COUNTED as child support income in the month of receipt.</p>
  <p>Child support arrearages paid by a household member (e.g., father) to another member who is in the home (e.g., mother) CANNOT be allowed as a child support deduction. However, child support payment paid by one household member to another is NOT counted as income.</p>
  <h2>Verification</h2>
  <p>Payments of child support must be verified. If the household fails or refuses to cooperate by supplying the necessary verifications, their eligibility and benefit level will be determined without a child support exclusion. Refer to <a href="../Verification/Chart.html">Verification Chart</a>.</p>
  <p>Refer to <a href="../Budgeting_Concepts/ChldSpptDsrgd.html#ChldSupPaid">Child Support Paid</a> for budgeting information.</p>
