  <p>Recipients are required to submit a “Semi-Annual Eligibility/Status Report once per year, which is due in the Submit Month (the sixth month of the semi-annual period).<br/>
  </p>
  <p>The following information is required to be reported on the SAR 7 report:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>All income received for the SAR Data Month (i.e., the fifth month of the semi-annual period),</li>
    <li>Any changes in household composition or resources that occurred since the submission of their last SAR 7 or RC forms through the end of the Data Month.</li>
    <li>Any change in income that the recipient anticipates will occur in the upcoming SAR Payment Period.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2><a id="MndtryMdPrd"></a>Mandatory Mid-Period Recipient Reports</h2>
  <p>Recipients are required to report specified changes to the county within 10 calendar days of the date the change becomes known to the household. Recipients may report these mid-period changes verbally, including in person or by telephone, or in writing. The worker MUST document the substance of the report, as well as the date of the report.</p>
  <p><a href="#" data-popovertext="Non-Assistance CalFresh " data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">NACF</a> households must report any of the following 3 changes during the semi-annual period:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>When their income exceeds the <a href="#" data-popovertext="Income Reporting Threshold " data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">IRT</a> of 130 percent of the <a href="#" data-popovertext="Federal Poverty Level " data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">FPL</a> for the household size.

    <li>When the household is in receipt of substantial lottery and/or gambling winnings.
      <ol>

        <li>The client’s verbal statement along with case documentation is sufficient verification.

  <p> </p>
  <p>Some mid-period changes are required to be reported in the CalWORKs program that are NOT required to be reported in the CalFresh. However, when there is a combined CalWORKs/CalFresh case, if the household reports a change that is required to be reported for CalWORKs, the EW must also act on the information to determine CalFresh eligibility/benefit amount.</p>
  <p>All CalWORKs recipients must report the following changes during the mid-period:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Fleeing felon status;</li>
    <li>Violation of conditions of probation or parole;</li>
    <li>Address changes; and</li>
    <li>When income exceeds the IRT.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Note: For mandatory reports to another public assistance program that are not acted upon, CalFresh will not act on the change.</p>
  <h3>CF 377.5 SAR</h3>
  <p>The “CalFresh Mid-Certification Period Status Report” (CF 377.5 SAR) must be provided to SAR reporting households at:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Certification.</li>
    <li>Recertification.</li>
    <li>Household request.</li>
    <li>Any time a CF 377.5 SAR is returned.</li>
  </ul>
  <p> </p>
  <p>This form is used for households to report mandatory mid-period changes in income that exceed the CalFresh IRT which is 130% of the FPL for the household size and ABAWD work hours. Households can use this form to voluntarily report other household changes that may result in increased benefits.</p>
  <h3>SAR 3</h3>
  <p>The “Mid-Period Status Report for Cash Aid and CalFresh” (SAR 3) must be provided to CalWORKs/CalFresh semi-annual reporting households at:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Certification.</li>
    <li>Recertification.</li>
    <li>Household request.</li>
    <li>Any time a SAR 3 is returned.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Income Reporting Threshold (IRT)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Households are required to report mid-period when their income exceeds their IRT. The CalFresh IRT is the amount of household gross income that renders most households ineligible for CalFresh benefits. The CalFresh IRT is based on the household size in existence at the time of certification (initial or recertification), or whenever a household composition changes. All households are continue to be required to report all income on their SAR 7 and at recertification.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p class="Note">Note: If CalWORKs benefits are decreased or discontinued due to the CalWORKs IRT, the county must also act to adjust the household’s CalFresh benefits.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Households determined eligible with gross income at or below 130 percent (%) of the FPL are required to report changes in income when the household&#39;s gross income exceeds 130% of the FPL during the SAR payment period.</li>
    <li>Households certified between 131% and 200% of the FPL are NOT required to make any reports of income during the SAR payment period. Such households do NOT have a CalFresh IRT because they have already reported income of over 130%. Per <a href="#" data-popovertext="Food and Nutrition Service " data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">FNS</a> guidance, a household is only required to report that its gross income exceeds 130% of the FPL one time during a reporting period.</li>
    <li>When the household with ineligible non-citizen (s) reports income over the IRT, the EW must calculate the household income based on the gross income of eligible members plus the prorated share of the ineligible non-citizen(s). In cases where this amount exceeds 200% of the FPL, the household’s <a href="#" data-popovertext="modified categorically eligible " data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">MCE</a> status must be removed and the removal of MCE status must be documented in the case record before the case can be terminated for exceeding the CalFresh gross income limit.
      <ul>
        <li><a class="dropspot" data-rhwidget="DropSpot" data-target="drop-down" href="#"><span data-open-text="true" data-skip-index="true">Example</span><span data-close-text="true">Example</span></a>
          <div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop-down">
            <p>An NACF MCE CalFresh household of three, consisting of an undocumented mother and two children with U.S. citizenship, has an IRT of $1,705. On March 5, during a January through December certification period, the household reports income over IRT with the mother earning $3,000 a month. The amount prorated to the household is $2,000 and benefits are adjusted accordingly. The household has fulfilled its mandatory reporting requirement for the remainder of the SAR payment period. On the SAR 7 submitted in June, the household reports a $1, 200 increase in monthly income. The total income combined with the $800 prorated increase to the CalFresh household is now $2,800 a month, the EW determines the household is no longer eligible, removes MCE status and send the household a timely discontinuance NOA.</p>

  <h3>Eligibility Determination when IRT is Reported</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>When a household reports their income may be over the CalFresh IRT (i.e., 130% FPL), the EW must ask if the income is expected to continue,
      <ul>
        <li>If the income is only expected to last for one month and will not continue to exceed its 130% IRT (i.e., the IRT was exceeded due to overtime or extra shifts), the income should not be used. A “no change” NOA must be provided to the household.</li>
        <li>If the household is not reasonably certain that the income will continue or does not know when to expect the income again, the EW must not discontinue the household or decrease the CalFresh allotment. However, the household must report if the unexpected income does continue.</li>
        <li>If the household reports mid-period income exceeds it IRT and the income will continue to exceed 130% of the FPL, the EW must determine if the household’s gross income does not exceed 200% of the FPL. If the household has gross income of over 200% of the FPL, the EW must remove the MCE status and document in the case record that the household is no longer MCE.</li>
        <li>The household’s statement is sufficient for <a href="#" data-popovertext="verified upon receipt " data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">VUR</a> when the household reports their income is over 130% (for non-MCE) or 200% (MCE) of the FPL.</li>
        <li>If the household expects the increased income to continue and verification is needed to change the CalFresh budget (MCE households only), send out the “Notice of Information/Verification Needed” (CF 377.6) to request verification of income.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="Note">Note: The CF 377.6 does not meet the requirements of the discontinuance notice. Therefore, if the requested verification is not received by the due date, the worker must send a timely discontinuance notice for lack of receipt of the requested information needed to accurately determine eligibility or benefit level.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>When a CalFresh household reports income over the 130% IRT, the EW must take the appropriate action depending on the reasonable anticipation of gross income for the remainder of the certification period.</p>

  <h3>Examples</h3>
  <p>The following are the examples related to IRT:</p>
  <h4>Scenario #1: Household with Gross Income at or Below 130% of FPL</h4>
  <p>A NACF household applies for benefits and has gross income at or below 130%of the FPL for the household size. This is documented in the case narrative and the household is conferred MCE status. The County must provide a SAR 2 that notifies the household of the CalFresh family size, current income and the 130% IRT amount for the household size. The household must report mid-period when gross income exceeds their IRT.</p>

  <div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop-down1">
    <p>If the household reports mid-period that its gross income exceeds its IRT and the income will continue to exceed the 130% of the FPL, the county must determine if the household’s gross income is under 200% of the FPL. If the household’s gross income is determined to be over 130% and at or below 200% of the FPL, the county must send a new SAR 2 that notifies the household of their CalFresh family size, current income, and that the household no longer has an IRT for reporting purposes.</p>

If the household has gross income of over 200% of the FPL, the county must remove the MCE status and document in the case record that the household is no longer MCE. <strong>The household’s statement is sufficient for Verified Upon Receipt (VUR) when the household reports their income is over 200 percent of the FPL. </strong>Since the non-elderly/disabled household exceeds the 130% of the FPL for CalFresh, the gross income test.</p>

      <br/>
      If the household has gross income of between 131% and 200% of the FPL, the county must send a new SAR 2 that notifies the household of their CalFresh family size, current income and that the household no longer has an IRT for reporting purposes.

    <p>If the household reports mid-period that its gross income exceeds its IRT and the income will continue to exceed the 130% of the FPL, the county must determine if the household’s gross income does not exceed 200% of the FPL. If the household’s gross income exceeds 200% of the FPL, the county must remove the MCE status and document in the case record that the household is no longer MCE. Since the household exceeds the 130% of the FPL for CalFresh, the household shall be discontinued.</p>

  <h4>Scenario #2: Households with Gross Income between 131% and 200% of the FPL</h4>
  <p>A NACF household applies for CalFresh and has gross income above 130% but the gross income does not exceed 200% of the FPL. The household is conferred MCE and this is documented in the case narrative. The county must send a SAR 2 notifying the household of their CalFresh family size, current gross income amount, and that they do not have an IRT amount. The household is not required to report again until their next SAR 7 or at recertification, whichever occurs first.</p>

  <h3>SAR 2 Reporting Changes for Cash Aid and CalFresh</h3>
  <p>The IRT must be provided to the CalFresh Household and CalWORKs AU using the SAR 2 form at approval of initial application and at any time the household/AU’s IRT changes during the certification period, whether the household has an IRT or not. The IRT can be listed on other forms, as long as counties ensure that the SAR 2 is issued to each household.</p>
  <h3>CalWORKs Discontinuance</h3>
  <p>In CalFresh, the family would no longer be categorically eligible once cash aid is discontinued due to financial ineligibility.</p>
  <p class="Note">Reminder: When CalWORKs is discontinued, Transitional CalFresh benefits must be set up for the household, if eligible, the first of the month after CalWORKs is discontinued.</p>
  <p class="Note">Refer to <a href="../TCF/TCFOvrvw.html">Transitional CalFresh Benefits</a> for detailed policy information regarding Transitional CalFresh.</p>
  <p class="Note">Exception: In the case where the CalFresh household consists of 2 AUs (one with senior mom and one with minor mom). If one AU discontinues from CalWORKs, the CalFresh household would not be eligible for Transitional CalFresh and it would remain regular CalFresh. Since one AU is still on CalWORKs and would no longer be CE, it is considered a mixed households and therefore the IRT test would apply.</p>

    <p>Mom in a nonexempt AU/household of three has gross earned income of $1,500 per month. The semi-annual period is August through January, and benefits for that period have been determined using $1,500 monthly as the average income amount. On September 15, mom
      <br/>
      reports that she was promoted and her monthly earnings increased to $2,500, which is greater than the IRT for her AU size ($1,566), and will continue at that level.
    </p>
    <p>After applying the appropriate income disregards, it is determined that the AU is ineligible for continuing cash aid, and cash benefits are discontinued effective September 30.</p>
    <p>In the CalFresh program, this family would no longer be categorically eligible once cash aid is discontinued due to financial ineligibility. Since the household’s anticipated income of $2,000 exceeds the gross income limit for a household of 3 ($2,116), it is determined that the household is ineligible for regular CalFresh benefits. The household’s regular CalFresh benefits would be discontinued effective September 30 and Transitional CalFresh benefits set up effective October 1.</p>
