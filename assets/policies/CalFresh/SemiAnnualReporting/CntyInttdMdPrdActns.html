  <h1><span data-field="title" data-format="default">County Initiated Mid-Period Actions</span></h1>
  <p>In addition to making mid-period adjustments to benefits as a result of mandatory and voluntary recipient reports, the county must also act on certain changes in eligibility status at the end of the month in which timely and adequate notice can be provided, even if it results in a decrease or termination of benefits. The changes in eligibility status listed below are considered county-initiated and these actions may occur at any time during the semi-annual period. They include, but are not limited to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Sanctions or financial penalties;</li>
    <li>Failure of a member of the household to comply with a Quality Control Review;</li>
    <li>Discontinuances due to the termination of a CalWORKs inter-county transfer;</li>
    <li>Benefits are applied for and approved for a household member in another household or for the household;</li>
    <li>CalWORKs is approved in mid period;</li>
    <li>Change from state funding <a href="#" data-popovertext="California Food Assistance Program " data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">CFAP</a> to federal <a href="#" data-popovertext="Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program" data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">SNAP</a> which must be seamless to the client;</li>
    <li><a href="#" data-popovertext="Cost-of-Living Adjustment " data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">COLA</a>s for the CalFresh, CalWORKs, General Assistance and for those COLAs administered by the Social Security Administration;</li>
    <li>Adjustments due to erroneous or incomplete recipient SAR 7 or mid-period reports of information or lack of action by the county on the SAR 7 or mid-period recipient reports;</li>
    <li>The three-month limit for an <a href="#" data-popovertext="Able Bodied Adult Without Dependents" data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">ABAWD</a> ends or an ABAWD who is not exempt and doesn’t reside in an area with an ABAWD waiver who has regained eligibility and subsequently stops meeting the work requirements;</li>
    <li>The county discovers Transitional CalFresh recipients have moved out-of-state and are receiving public benefits (<a href="#" data-popovertext="Temporary Assistance for Needy Families " data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">TANF</a> and/or SNAP) in another state; and</li>
    <li>A member of the household receives <a href="#" data-popovertext="Supplemental Security Income and/or California State Supplementary Payment" data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">SSI/SSP</a> benefits.</li>
    <li>Adding a sanctioned person back to the household the month following the expiration of the disqualification period without a request from the household, if the household is otherwise eligible.</li>
    <li>TCVAP benefits and services are terminated as a result of:
      <ul>
        <li>The individual’s application for a T visa has been finally denied;</li>
        <li>The individual has not applied for a T Visa within one year; or</li>
        <li>The individual is certified by the Office of Refugee Resettlement and transferred to the federally-funded program.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Move Out of State</h2>
  <p>If the county determines that the household is no longer or will not be residing in the state, CalFresh benefits must be terminated in mid-period at the end of the month in which a timely notice can be sent. An OI may be established if the household was residing out of state and continued to receive benefits from California.</p>
  <h2>Transitional CalFresh</h2>
  <p>If TANF grants of SNAP benefits are received out-of-state while transitional benefits are received in CA, Transitional CalFresh must be discontinued, and there would be an OI if SNAP benefits were concurrently issued in another state. However, if public benefits are not received out-of-state while transitional benefits are received in CA then the TCF benefits would continue for the full duration of the TCF benefit period.</p>
  <h2>Joint CalWORKs/CalFresh Application</h2>
  <p>When a joint CalWORKs and CalFresh application is taken and Public Assistance eligibility is pending, if CalWORKs is granted after CalFresh has been paid, the new CalWORKs income must be used to recompute CalFresh benefits mid-period. This is considered a County-Initiated Action. Refer to <a href="../Budgeting_Concepts/BdgtgCncpts.html#Prospective">PA Grant [63-509(h)(3)(B)]</a> for additional information and examples of the treatment of a CalWORKs grant.</p>
  <h3>LATE SAR 7</h3>
  <p>A mid-period benefit adjustment is also initiated if such an adjustment is necessary as a result of a late SAR 7 being submitted by the recipient. Submission of a late SAR 7, may require that benefits be reduced for the SAR Payment Period. However, if benefits cannot be decreased due to an inability to provide 10-day notice, benefits for the first month of the SAR Payment Period must be released at the prior level. The EW must take action to reduce benefits effective the first day of the next month in that SAR Payment Period when 10-day notice of decrease in benefits can be provided.</p>
  <p>An <a href="#" data-popovertext="Inadvertent Household Error (63-801.21), An overissuance caused by a misunderstanding or unintentional error on the part of the household, or the sponsor of a noncitizen household. In most cases an overissuance which results from errors on the part of both the county and the household is considered an IHE. An overissuance which results from intentional non-reporting by the household is considered an IHE until it is legally declared to be an intentional program violation (IPV)." data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">IHE</a> overissuance MUST be established when a recipient submits a late SAR 7 (after the 11th of the SAR submit month) which results in the household receiving more benefits than to which it is entitled because of the county’s inability to decrease benefits due to the 10-day notice requirement. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>If the SAR 7 is received timely (by the 11th of the Submit Month) but was not processed or was processed incorrectly by the county, then an <a href="#" data-popovertext="Administrative Error " data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">AE</a> overissuance must be established if the household will receive more benefits than to which it is entitled for the SAR Payment Period.</li>
    <li>If the SAR 7 is submitted late (after the 11th of the Submit Month), but before the NOA cut-off; however was not processed by the county until after the NOA cut-off, then an IHE overissuance must be established if the household will receive more benefits than to which it is entitled for the SAR Payment Period.</li>
    <li>If the SAR 7 is submitted after the NOA cut-off, but by the Extended Filing Date, then an IHE overissuance must be established if the household will receive more benefits than to which it is entitled for the SAR Payment Period.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Process the SAR 7 as if it had been received before NOA cutoff. Follow the chart below when determining the amount of benefits. IF </p>
  <ul>
    <li>If benefits will increase or remain the same, then 
      <ul>
        <li>Revise the budget.</li>
        <li>Issue benefits in a timely manner.</li>
        <li>Send an appropriate NOA.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>If benefits will decrease, then 
      <ul>
        <li>Issue benefits for at least the same amount as was indicated on the last valid NOA sent.</li>
        <li>Revise the budget for the remaining months of the Payment Period to decrease benefits.</li>
        <li>Establish an overissuance for the 1st month of the SAR Payment Period which occurred due to the inability to decrease benefits with a 10 day notice.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Refer to <a href="../SAR7Processing/PrcssgSAR7.html">Complete SAR 7 Received After NOA Cutoff [63-508.65]</a> for more details.</p>
  <h2>Third Party/Known to the County Information</h2>
  <p>Under certain circumstances, information will be “known to the county” or will be provided to the county through a third-party. Such information should be used by the county to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Calculate an OP/OI when the information received was a mandatory report and is obtained after benefits have been issued in the wrong amount, such as in the case of <a href="#" data-popovertext="Income and Eligibility Verification System " data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">IEVS</a> matches; and</li>
    <li>Take prospective action to change benefits mid-period or at the beginning of a semi-annual period if the county learns that the recipient failed to accurately report changes on a mandatory mid-period report or on the SAR 7 or RC forms.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>All third party information that is received by or known to the county must be acted upon in accordance with SAR rules.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If a change is required to be reported by the recipient under SAR rules, the county must take action to verify the information and take action based on the information once it has been verified.</li>
    <li>If a change is not required to be reported, such as a change of income not over IRT that occurs mid-period, the county may use the third party information as ancillary information to ensure that the next semi-annual report submitted by the recipient is consistent with other information known to the county.
      <ul>
        <li class="Note">
          <p class="Note">Note: If a change that was not required to be reported is considered VUR, the county must act on the change mid period.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>If the information on the SAR 7 or RC forms is not consistent with what has already been reported or is being reported through a third party, the county must seek to resolve the discrepancy. If the county cannot resolve the discrepancy, the SAR 7 or RC forms may be considered incomplete.</li>
  </ul>
