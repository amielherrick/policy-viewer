  <h3>Definition</h3>
  <p>Allow a deduction for unreimbursed medical expenses in excess of $35.00 per month incurred by any household member who is:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Receiving disability benefits under the Social Security Act on their own account, or</li>
    <li>Age 60 or older.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>When a household member turns 60, allow a deduction for medical expenses in the month after the 60th birthday.<br/>
  </p>
  <p>When a one-time medical expense is averaged, the medical expense is averaged over the remaining month of the certification period and $35 is deducted form the average for each month.</p>
  <h3>California’s Standard Medical Deduction (SMD) Demonstration Project</h3>
  <p>The <a href="#" data-popovertext="California Department of Social Services " data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">CDSS</a> has been authorized by the <a href="#" data-popovertext="United States Department of Agriculture " data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">USDA</a>, <a href="#" data-popovertext="Food and Nutrition Service " data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">FNS</a>, to operate <a href="#" data-popovertext="Standard Medical Deduction " data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">SMD</a> from October 1, 2017, to September 30, 2021. With an extension approval, California has been authorized to continue operating the SMD Demonstration Project from October 1, 2021, to September 30, 2025.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Under the SMD Project, CDSS established a standard deduction of $150 for households with an elderly and/or disabled member, with verified medical expenses between $35.01 and $185 per month.<br/>
  </p>
  <p>To qualify for the SMD, a household with an elderly or disabled member must verify that their monthly medical expenses are more than $35. However, they are not required to verify all of their monthly medical expenses. For instance, if the household incurs medical expenses of $40 and $50 per month, they only need to provide proof of one expense that exceeds $35.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Households  with an elderly and/or disabled member that want to claim monthly medical expenses exceeding $185.00 must provide proof of the actual expenses. If a household claims medical expenses above $185.00 per month without verifying them, the household may receive the SMD based on verified expenses between $35.01 and $185.00.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>The following table summarizes establishing medical deductions.</p>

  </ul>
  <p class="Note">Note: If an emotional support animal is trained to assist an elderly or disabled person, it must be treated as a service animal. The costs of securing and maintaining an emotional support animal that meets the definition of a service animal are allowable medical expenses.</p>
  <p class="Note">Note: Verification of a Service Animal’s Status<br/>
    If it is evident that an animal is specially trained to perform a function that an older adult or disabled person cannot readily perform on their own, the County must consider this animal a service animal and allow the costs of securing and maintaining the service animal as medical expenses. A case comment noting the eligibility worker’s observation (in-person contact) or confirmation of the service through the questions is sufficient verification for this purpose.<br/>
    EW must not require formal documentation or proof of certification or licensing to verify that an animal is a service animal.</p>
  <p><a class="dropspot" data-rhwidget="DropSpot" data-target="drop-down4" href="#"><span data-open-text="true" data-skip-index="true">Example</span><span data-close-text="true">Example</span></a></p>
  <div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop-down4">
    <p>If a dog is observed guiding an applicant who is blind or has low vision, a case comment noting the EW observed the use of the dog as a service animal is sufficient verification that the animal is a service animal.</p>
  </div>
  <p>If it is questionable whether an animal qualifies as a service animal, EWs may only ask the recipient/applicant the following questions:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>If the animal is required because of a disability and</li>
    <li>What tasks is the animal trained to perform?</li>
    <li>A case comment that states the animal is required because of a disability and lists the tasks the animal is trained to perform is sufficient verification when the status of a service animal is questionable.</li>
  </ol>
  <p class="Note">Note: Medical Reimbursement for Service Animals<br/>
    Direct payments to service animal owners intended to cover costs associated with a service animal must not be considered income to determine CalFresh eligibility and must be excluded from unearned income as medical reimbursement.</p>
  <p><a class="dropspot" data-rhwidget="DropSpot" data-target="drop-down5" href="#"><span data-open-text="true" data-skip-index="true">Example</span><span data-close-text="true">Example</span></a></p>
  <div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop-down5">
    <p>Payments such as the $50.00 stipend from the Assistance Dog Special Allowance Program are not counted as unearned income when determining CalFresh eligibility. However, when determining the amount of medical expenses in accordance with the direct payment must be excluded from the individual’s total medical expenses.</p>
  </div>
  <ul>
    <li> Eyeglasses or contact lenses prescribed by a physician skilled in eye disease or by an optometrist; dentures, hearing aids, and prosthetics (including assistive devices).</li>
    <li>The actual cost of transportation to health care appointments, trips to a pharmacy or other location to fill prescriptions, fittings for dentures, hearing aids, or glasses, and trips to the doctor, dentist, etc. Households must verify expenses if they claim the out-of-pocket, non-reimbursed cost for medical travel of elderly and/or disabled members by third parties such as public transportation, taxis, or ride-sharing companies such as Uber or Lyft.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="Note">Note: Medical travel trips are not required to be within the county of residence.</p>
  <h3>Verification of Medical Travel by Private Vehicle</h3>
  <p>When a qualified client travels by private vehicle, rather than paying for a ride directly to a third party, they may claim the expense based on the trip&#39;s mileage. To verify medical travel by private vehicle, the EW must accept a verbal or written client statement that travel was required for medical reasons unless questionable.</p>
  <p>The Eligibility Worker (EW) can use the information provided by the household, including the starting and ending location of the travel required for medical reasons, to determine the total mileage amount, including round-trip mileage, if applicable. A copy of the map or directions documenting the mileage amount must be kept in the case record as verification of the travel expense. Gas receipts are not required.</p>
  <h3>Standard Statewide Mileage Rate for Medical Travel</h3>
  <p>When determining the expense amount for mileage incurred for medical travel using a private vehicle, The EW must multiply the number of miles for the trip by the statewide mileage rate. The EW must review the current IRS standard business rate to ensure that the correct mileage rate is used.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Lodging to obtain medical treatment or services.</li>
    <li>The cost of maintaining an attendant, homemaker, home health aide, or child care services housekeeper is necessary due to age, infirmity, or illness. In addition, an amount equal to the one-person coupon allotment will be deducted if the household furnishes most of the attendant&#39;s meals. The allotment for this meal-related deduction shall be that in effect at the time of the most recent certification. The EW shall update the allotment amount at the next scheduled recertification, the next recomputation, or the next reported change by the household, whichever is earlier. If a household incurs attendant care costs that could qualify under the medical and dependent care deductions, it will be treated as a medical expense.</li>
    <li>20% of the total medical bills (other than hospital expenses) will be the household’s medical cost when the eligible household member is covered by Medi-Care or Blue Cross/Blue Shield or private insurance and the unreimbursed portion of actual costs UNKNOWN.</li>
    <li>Unpaid medical bills occurred before certification and were obligated to be paid during the certification.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Nonallowable Costs [63-503.251]</h2>
  <p>Do not allow a deduction for:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Medical bills paid before the month of initial application.</li>
    <li>Special diet expenses (e.g., “Boost” or “Ensure”)</li>
    <li>Premiums for accident policies</li>
    <li>Medical expenses that are reimbursable by insurance or other public or private sources</li>
    <li>Medical marijuana</li>
    <li>Vitamins and supplements unless prescribed by a physician.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Forms</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The household must complete the Medical Expenses Section of the CF 285 or SAWS 2 Plus at Intake and Recertification.</li>
    <li>CF 31-&quot;CalFresh Supplemental Form for Special Medical Deductions” is a recommended form and is used when:
      <ul>
        <li>Adding a person to an existing case and the person being added is elderly (60 or older) or disabled (disability approved by Social Security), or</li>
        <li>An existing CalFresh household member turns 60 or is determined disabled mid-period.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Verification</h2>
  <p>The household member must provide verification before any deduction can be applied to the CalFresh budget. Medical deductions should NOT be allowed if the applicant or recipient fails to provide the required verification.</p>
  <p>Examples of various types of verifications are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Medical bills or receipts</li>
    <li>Medical transportation bills or receipts</li>
    <li>Health or dental insurance policies or premiums</li>
    <li>Medicare card (for Medi-Cal only)</li>
    <li>Doctor statement or disability finding by an agency (SSA/SDI/VA, etc.)</li>
    <li>Medical verification form (CW61)</li>
    <li>CalFresh Supplemental Form for Excess Medical Deductions (CF 31)</li>
    <li>Request for Verification (CW 2200)</li>
