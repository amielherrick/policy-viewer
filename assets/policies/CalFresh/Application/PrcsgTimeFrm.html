  <h2>Denial of Applications due to Verification</h2>
  <p>Deny the application ON OR BEFORE the 30th day if the household fails to provide missing verification(s), only when all of the following actions have been taken:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The application interview was held and all needed verification were requested, and</li>
    <li>The household was informed of the 10-day standard in writing and was notified at the interview of the due date by which the household must provide any missing verification, and</li>
    <li>The EW assisted the household, if necessary, to obtain verification. Refer to <a href="../Verification/VrfctnReqsRcrt.html#63-300.5(i)">Responsibility for Obtaining Verification [63-300.5(i)]</a>.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Verification [63-300.51]</h2>
  <p>Verification is the use of third-party information or documentation to establish the accuracy of statements on the application. Prior to determining eligibility for applicant households, sufficient information concerning the applicant’s situation must be obtained in order for the EW to make an informed judgment as to the household’s eligibility. Verification and documentation are tools for making this judgment and recording the decision-making process in the case file. Refer to <a href="../Verification/Overview.html">Verification</a>.</p>
  <h3>Mandatory Verification</h3>
  <p>The EW must verify the following information prior to certification for households initially applying:</p>
  <ul class="Disc">
    <li>Gross Non-exempt Income </li>
    <li>Non-citizen Status</li>
    <li>Identity</li>
    <li>Social Security Numbers</li>
    <li>Residency</li>
    <li>Medical Expenses</li>
    <li>Child Support Obligation and Actual Payments</li>
    <li>Sponsored Non-citizens</li>
    <li>Disability</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Refer to <a href="../Verification/VerfctnType.html#Mandatory">Mandatory Verification [63-300.5(e)]</a> for additional information.</p>
  <h3>Optional Verification [63-300.52]</h3>
  <p>Optional verification may be requested when the information is inconsistent, incomplete or questionable.</p>
  <p>Optional verification include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Dependent Care</li>
    <li>Liquid resources or loans</li>
    <li>Household Size</li>
    <li>Shelter costs</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Refer to <a href="../Verification/CEHousehlds.html#Optional">Optional Verification [63-300.5(f): ACL 20-135]</a> for additional information.</p>
  <h2>Missing Verification of Deductions [63-300.5]</h2>
  <p>If obtaining verification of a DEDUCTION (shelter, dependent care, child support expense, or medical expense) may delay benefit approval beyond the normal 30-day limit, the EW must advise the household that they:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>May choose to have eligibility and benefits determined without the deduction, and</li>
    <li>Will receive a deduction for the current and future months only if verification is provided at a later date.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="Reminder"><strong>Reminder</strong>: The EW is required to assist the household in obtaining verification if the household is UNABLE to do so. (This does not apply to a household that is able, but REFUSES to obtain verification.)</p>
  <p class="Note"><span style="font-weight:bold;">Note</span>: Benefits may be approved prior to obtaining the verification of a deduction, but benefits may not be approved prior to obtaining an item considered a mandatory verification, with the exception of those specified in “Expedited Services”. Refer to <a href="ES/Documentaton.html#verification">Verification [63-301.54]</a>.</p>
  <h3>HH Chooses to Wait for Verification</h3>
  <p>If the household chooses to delay the determination of eligibility and benefits until verification can be obtained, process the application normally by allowing the household at least 30 days after the date of application to provide the verification.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If verification is provided by the requested date, approve or deny benefits at that time.</li>
    <li>If verification is not provided by the 30th day, deny the application for failure to provide verification.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The beginning date of aid shall be established as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If the household provides the verification during the first 30 days, determine eligibility and benefits beginning with the date of application.</li>
    <li>If the household provides the verification during the second 30 days, determine eligibility and benefits beginning with the day that the requested verification is received.</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop-down14">

  </div>
  <h3>HH Chooses Not to Wait for Verification</h3>
  <p>If the household chooses to have eligibility and benefits determined without waiting for the missing verification, then approve or deny benefits immediately without the verification, disallowing the deduction.</p>
  <p>If the household provides verification at a later date, a deduction can be allowed for current and future months only (not past months).</p>
  <p><a class="dropspot" data-rhwidget="DropSpot" data-target="drop-down20" href="#"><span data-open-text="true" data-skip-index="true">Example</span><span data-close-text="true">Example</span></a></p>
  <div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop-down20">
    <p>A household applies on 5/1, and chooses to have benefits determined without a deduction for utilities because verification is missing. Benefits are authorized without a utility deduction on 5/3. On 6/4, the household provides a copy of the May utility bill. Count this amount as a deduction for June and future months. The CalFresh budget for May will remain unchanged.</p>

    <p>The family of three applies for CalWORKs and CalFresh on July 25. Mom has just been laid off and received her last paycheck on July 20. Her total earnings for July are $2,000. Each child also receives $200 from absent dad’s disability. The current income puts the family over the applicant income test for CalWORKs and CalFresh, but it appears they would be eligible beginning in August. <br/>
      The AU/household is denied benefits for the month of July and is approved for the second month forward using the same application for benefits.</p>
  </div>
  <h2>Delayed Action: 2nd 30 Days [63-301.4]</h2>
  <p>If the County does not determine a household’s eligibility and provides an opportunity to participate within 30 days of the date the application was filed, it is considered a delayed action. Examples are:</p>
  <h3>Administrative Delay</h3>
  <p>If there is a delay in processing due to any of the reasons below, the delay will be considered administrative:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The EW must have offered, or attempted to offer, help in completion of the application.</li>
    <li>The EW must have provided the household with a written statement of verification requirements for CalFresh applicants (CF 285,“Coversheet”).</li>
    <li>The EW must have informed the household of any work registration requirements and given the household 10 days from the date of the notice to comply.</li>
    <li>If the applicant is having trouble providing needed verification, the EW must have attempted to help the applicant obtain them. The EW must allow 10 DAYS from the date the verification was requested.</li>
    <li>The EW must have offered to make a collateral contact (by mail or phone) in situations in which the missing verification would be difficult or impossible to obtain in a timely manner.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="Note">Note: This also applies in “same-day processing” situations.</p>
  <h3>Administrative Delay Procedures</h3>
  <p>When a delay in the initial 30-day application processing period is due to administrative reasons, such as a backlog, the application should NOT be denied on the 30th day following the application was filed. The application process must be continued as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A notice of pending status must be sent to the household by the 30th day following the date the application was filed. The notice must indicate any action necessary by the household to complete the application process. The case must be held “pending” for an additional 30 days.</li>
    <li>The No Change NOA, “Notice of Denial or Pending Status” (CF 377.1A) is used to inform the household of pending status. The CF 377.1A can be generated from the Template Repository or printed from the online DEBS Forms Library.</li>
    <li>If the application is held pending, the EW must take action on the application during the second 30-day processing period as follows:
      <ul>
        <li>If verification has not been provided, then the application can be pended for only 30 days following the date of the initial request for the particular verification that is missing (up to the second 30th day).</li>
        <li>If the household fails to take the required action by the date specified on the notice of action, then the application can be denied at the end of the second 30 days. No additional notice is required since the “Notice of Denial and Pending Status” (CF 377.1A) satisfies the informing requirement.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Households found eligible during the second 30 days are eligible to retroactive benefits from the month of application.</li>
    <li>If the household is determined ineligible during the second 30-day processing period, the application must be denied and the denial notice must be provided to the household.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Household Delay Procedures</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>A new application is not required during the second 30-day period.</li>
    <li>The application must still be held “pending” for an additional 30 days regardless of the reason the household has failed to provide what is necessary to complete the application.</li>
    <li>No retroactive benefits for the month of application will be issued when the household was at fault in the first 30 days but completes the application in the second 30 days and is eligible.</li>
    <li>Benefits are issued from the date required information/verification is received by the county. Refer to <a href="../Budgeting_Concepts/Computation.html#BenefitProration">Benefit Proration</a> for proration instructions.</li>
    <li>Deny households who do not complete the application in the second 30 days. No additional notice of action is required if a pending notice was sent after the end of the first 30-day period.</li>
