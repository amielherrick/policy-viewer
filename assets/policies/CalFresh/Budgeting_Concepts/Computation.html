      <li>Entering case information into CalSAWS, or</li>
      <li>Using a “CalFresh Budget Worksheet” (CF 286 SAR).</li>
    </ul>
    <p> </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Add the anticipated monthly unearned income of all household members after subtracting allowable child support payment, if any.</li>
      <li>Add the anticipated gross monthly earned income for all household members (minus earned income exclusions) to determine the household&#39;s total monthly gross earned income.</li>
      <li>Subtract the earned income deduction* from the monthly gross earned income.</li>
      <li>Add all the income (Earned + Unearned).</li>
      <li>Subtract the standard deduction*.</li>
      <li>Subtract monthly averaged dependent care expenses, if any.</li>
      <li>Total the allowable shelter expenses (housing and utilities) to determine shelter costs.</li>
      <li>Subtract from the total shelter costs 50 percent of the household&#39;s monthly income after all the above deductions have been subtracted. The remaining amount, if any, is the excess shelter cost.
        <ol>
          <li>Is there an excess shelter cost?
            <ol>
              <li>If NO, the amount in STEP 7 is the household&#39;s net monthly income. Go to STEP 10.</li>
              <li>If YES, Subtract the excess shelter cost (up to the current maximum*) from the household&#39;s monthly income after all other deductions. This amount is the household&#39;s net monthly income.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Round the net monthly income amount:

          <li>Down for calculations that end in 1 through 49 cents, and</li>
          <li>Up for calculations that end in 50 through 99 cents.</li>
        </ol>
