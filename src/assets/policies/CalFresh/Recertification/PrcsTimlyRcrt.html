    <li>Send an approval or denial NOA prior to the end of the household&#39;s current certification period. A 10-day <a href="#" data-popovertext="Notice of Action " data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">NOA</a> is not required to decrease benefits for the first month of a new certification period.
      <ol>
        <li>This is technically considered an approval of recertification (even though it is for a lower benefit amount), rather than a decrease in benefits.</li>

            <p>A recertification is completed in August, the last month of the certification period. Benefits will be approved effective September 1 at a lower amount due to increased anticipated earnings. An approval NOA is issued to notify the household that CalFresh have been recertified (at the lower amount) effective September 1. A decrease NOA is not required because the household&#39;s certification period expired August 31, and no benefits were guaranteed beyond that date.</p>
          </div>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <ol>
        <li>Date(s) of the interview.</li>
