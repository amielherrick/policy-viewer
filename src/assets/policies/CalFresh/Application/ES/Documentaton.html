  <p>Whether a household completes any part of Expedited Benefits section on the CalFresh application, all applications must be screened for <a href="#" data-popovertext="Expedited Services " data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">ES</a>, and the County Use Section pertaining to ES must be completed by the <a href="#" data-popovertext="Eligibility Worker" data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">EW</a> to indicate that:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The case was evaluated for ES, and</li>
    <li>ES was approved or denied.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The reasons for denial should be documented in the case record.</p>
  <h2><a id="timeliness"></a>Timeliness Standards</h2>
  <p>The County must provide households with an active <a href="#" data-popovertext="Electronic Benefit Transfer " data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">EBT</a> card and PIN number made available to access benefits that have been posted onto their EBT account and made available for use within the ES issuance timeline. Refer to <a href="#Issuance">Issuance</a><a href="#Issuance"> Deadline [63-301.531]</a>.</p>
  <p>The County must post benefits to the household’s EBT account and mail or have EBT cards available for pick-up in time to ensure that the recipient can access his/her benefits by the three day ES timeframe. Mailing time does not count toward the ES three day timeframe.</p>
  <p>For applications completed with an interactive interview, and a telephonic signature is acquired, the filling date is the date of the interview. The three-day ES timeline begins from the date <a href="#" data-popovertext="Timeliness Standard" data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">TS</a> is captured.</p>

  <div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop-down">
    <p>An applicant files his/her application on Monday (day zero) and is determined eligible for ES. The EW calls the applicant and completes the interview on Tuesday (day one). The same day the EW informs the applicant to come into the office to pick up his/her EBT card and select their PIN number to access their CalFresh benefits. The applicant is having car trouble so he/she asks the EW to mail the card instead. The EW mails the EBT card and PIN number separately to the applicant household that afternoon. The ES clock stops when the EW mails the EBT card and PIN number to the household. The household receives the EBT card on Thursday (day two) and PIN number on Friday (day three). The County has met the ES timeframe on day one when both the EBT card and PIN number where put in the mail at the household’s request.</p>
  </div>
  <p class="Note">Reminder: If the client was not eligible for ES at application but the ES application is pending, the worker must deny the ES application in CalSAWS before approving regular CalFresh benefits. Otherwise, if the clients situation has changed since the application, CalSAWS will approve the CalFresh ES application along with the regular CalFresh application, causing the case to be out of compliance with CalFresh ES regulations.</p>

    <p>Rico Mole applies for CalFresh on 03/20. He indicates he would like
      <br/>
      ES CalFresh benefits and is referred to Triage. It is determined that he does not meet the criteria for ES CalFresh. However, due to an oversight, the ES denial is not entered into CalSAWS. On 04/06, Rico returns to the office for his regular CalFresh appointment. He has lost his job and is out of money.The worker enters the changes in his circumstances into CalSAWS.
      <br/>
      Both the ES and regular CalFresh applications are still pending. It is imperative that the application for ES CalFresh benefits dated 03/20 be denied. If it is not, CalSAWS will approve the pending ES CalFresh application dated 03/20. This will cause the case to show as being out of compliance with CalFresh ES regulations.

  <h2>Processing Delays and Impact on ES Entitlement</h2>
  <p>A delay in meeting the three-day expedited processing timeframe does not change a household’s entitlement to ES. A household’s entitlement to ES is not lost due to a delay in meeting the expedited processing timeframe. Therefore, if a household is entitled to ES, and the EW cannot schedule the initial interview within the three-day expedited processing timeframe, the EW must continue processing the application on an expedited basis. The requirement to process an application on an expedited basis stands even if an interview cannot be scheduled within three-days. In the case of an expedited processing delay, the household remains entitled to ES until the household receives their benefits. Exception: There are two exceptions to this rule. A household may lose ES entitlement if (1) the household’s circumstances change and the household no longer meets the criteria for ES entitlement or (2) the household is scheduled for an initial interview within the three-day expedited processing timeframe and the household misses the scheduled interview. Under these two circumstances the household will lose ES entitlement and the household’s application will be processed under the normal CalFresh processing timeframe.</p>
  <h2>.<a id="mail"></a>Mail Applications</h2>
  <p>When a mail application is received incomplete and must be returned to the client, do not count the following days as part of the ES processing time period:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Days the application is in the mail to and from the household, or</li>
    <li>Days the application is in the household&#39;s possession.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2><a id="SSN"></a>SSN Requirement [63-404.21]</h2>
  <p>ES households are not required to provide or apply for a <a href="#" data-popovertext="Social Security Number " data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">SSN</a> until after receiving their first allotment. They must, however, provide an SSN or proof of application for an SSN for all household members before the next issuance.</p>
  <h2><a id="workreg"></a>Work Registration [63-301.541(d), 63-407.1]</h2>
  <p>All nonexempt household members must be registered for work before ES CalFresh may be issued.</p>
  <p>Questionable work registration exemptions must be verified prior to issuance, if possible. However, verification must be postponed if it will prevent issuing benefits by the ES deadline.</p>
  <h2><a id="verification"></a>Verification [63-301.54]</h2>
  <p>Use the chart below to determine ES verification requirements.</p>
