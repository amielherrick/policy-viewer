      <ol>
        <li>1st-15th of the month, then issue benefits for the 1st (application) month.
          <ol>
            <li>EXCEPTION: Issue benefits for both the 1st and 2nd months if ES eligibility is discovered late and it is already the 2nd month when the application is approved.</li>

        </li>
        <li>If applicable, that an individual HH member will be discontinued if SSN, or student or alien status verification is not received within 30 days after the date of application.</li>
        <li>No advance notice will be given if verification (or lack of child support verification) results in changes in the household’s eligibility or benefit level.</li>

    <li>Set an alert to:

        <li>Discontinue benefits for the individual or household within 30 days of the application date if the missing verification has not been provided. [Refer to “When Postponed Verification Isn&#39;t Received [63-301.541],” page 7-9].]

            <li>If postponed verification affects only some individual(s) in the household (such as proof of an SSN, or verification of alien or student status), then discontinue only the affected individual(s); not the entire household.</li>
            <li>Households which are initially certified as nonassistance, but which later become <a href="#" data-popovertext="Categorically Eligible " data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">CE</a>, must still provide all the verification which was required at the initial nonassistance ES certification.

  <div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop-down">
    <p>A member of the applicant household does not have an SSN or proof of application for one within the ES processing timeframe.<br/>
      Certify the entire household for ES pending verification of the SSN. If the missing SSN (or proof of application) is not provided by the 30th day following application, discontinue that household member only. Send an adequate (not 10-day) NOA.</p>

    <p>An applicant household is missing verification of rent and child support deductions which cannot be provided within the ES timeframe.</p>
    <p>Certify the household and allow the deduction in the month of application with postponed verification.</p>
    <p>If the postponed verification is not received by the 30th day following application, discontinue the entire household. A NOA is not required.</p>
    <p>If the rent verification is received, but the child support verification is not, recompute continued eligibility and benefits without the child support deduction.

    <p>A household files a joint application for CalWORKs and CalFresh and is approved for ES with postponed verification of a deduction. The household is later determined eligible for CalWORKs and becomes CE. The postponed verification of the deduction is not provided by the 30th day from the date of application.</p>
    <p>As a result of the household being certified under ES, all ES requirements would still apply. Therefore, as the postponed verification (of the deduction) would affect the household&#39;s eligibility or benefit level, discontinue the entire household. A NOA is not required.</p>

After the 30th day, the household is approved for CalWORKs and becomes CE.</p>
    <p>Since the missing SSN information (an individual eligibility factor) was not provided by the 30th day, discontinue only that household member. Send an adequate (not 10-day) NOA.</p>
    <p>In addition, as CE status does not take precedence over ES provisions, the affected household member will continue to be ineligible until the SSN information is provided.</p>

  <h2><a id="Farmworker"></a>Migrant/Seasonal Farmworkers with Postponed Verification</h2>
  <p>The following are ES verification regulations specific to migrant Farmworker households:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>When the only missing verification is from an out-of state source, migrant HHs must receive the second month’s benefits regardless </li>
    <li>of when the application was submitted during the month of application.</li>
    <li>Migrant farm worker HHs must be entitled to postpone our-of state verification only once each migrant farm season. If a migrant farmworker HH is entitled to ES and has already received this exception during the current migrant farm season, the County must grant a postponement of the our-of state verification for only the initial month.</li>
    <li>When postponed verification is received, issue the third month’s benefits within five working days from receipt of the verification or by the first working day of the third month, whichever is later.</li>
    <li>If the out-of-state verification is not completed within 60 days, following the date the application was filed, the case must be discontinued. The household is not entitled to ES when they reapply or restored their eligibility.</li>
    <li>A migrant farm season is defined as having a clear beginning point and ending point between which migrant farmworkers travel. When they are not migrating to work they are residing at one location which they regard as home. In this case, the season would be the period during which the migrants are traveling to work. If a migrant farmworker travels constantly with no break period, the season will be considered the calendar year.</li>
