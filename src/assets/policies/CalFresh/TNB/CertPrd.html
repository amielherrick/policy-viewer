  <h1><span data-field="title" data-format="default">Certification Period</span></h1>
  <p>Households eligible for the TNB Program must be certified for a 12-month period. After that, households may be re-certified for an additional 12-month period.</p>
  <h2><a id="TNBRect"></a>TNB Program Recertification (RC)</h2>
  <p>TNB Program eligibility may not continue beyond the current certification period without completing the TNB RC requirements.<br/>
    After the initial 12-month certification, continuing TNB eligibility will be determined every 12 months at the household’s TNB Program recertification.</p>
  <p>The TNB Program recertification process itself does not require an interview. However, if the TNB Program household must submit a CalFresh application, a full CalFresh eligibility determination, including an interview, is required.</p>
  <h3>Recertification Suspension</h3>
  <p>Recertification for all TNB households will be suspended beginning November 2021 for 24 months or the system completes the necessary RC and restoration period extension. The suspension applies to all households who receive TNB benefits for the November benefit month, including those discontinued prior to November, and the discontinuance is later rescinded due to program compliance (new 90-day rescind period) or as a result of Administrative Hearing compliance.</p>
  <p>During the suspension, TNB RC-related forms (TNB 4 &amp; TNB 5) will not be sent, and TNB-eligible households will not be required to complete recertification to maintain TNB Program eligibility. After the suspension period, recertification will commence on a staggered basis, depending on the TNB household’s original recertification due date.</p>
  <p>All TNB households must remain active for the RC suspension period unless the TNB recipient requests to leave the program or one of the few reasons for discontinuance. If a reason for discontinuance occurs, the EW will need to manually discontinue the TNB after the pause begins.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>TNB-eligible households can be recertified for an additional 12 months without completing mid-period reports or a SAR 7, as long as they meet eligibility criteria.</p>
  <h3>Recertification Resumption </h3>
  <p>The TNB recertification process will resume starting the November 2023 recertification month. The &quot; Notice of Recertification for the Transitional Nutrition Benefit Program&quot; (TNB 4) must be sent to TNB households in the month prior to the household&#39;s TNB renewal month. This process will start from October 2023 for the November renewals. </p>
  <h2>TNB 4</h2>
  <p>The &quot;Notice of Recertification for the Transitional Nutrition Benefit Program&quot; (TNB 4) serves as both a notice of certification expiration and the TNB Program recertification form. TNB 4 must be sent to the household at least 45 days before the TNB Program certification expiration.<br/>
  </p>
  <p>The TNB 4 must be submitted to the County by the 15th day of the last month of the TNB Program certification period. The TNB Program household must answer all of the four yes-no questions. If an answer is “yes” to any of the four questions, the household must submit a CalFresh application and the TNB 4 by the due date.</p>
  <h2>Timely Processing</h2>
  <p>TNB 4 is considered timely when it is submitted to the County by the 15th day of the last month of the expiring certification period. If a household meets the certification requirements before the end of the certification period and continues to be TNB-eligible, the County must provide the household with a notice of approval by the last day of the household’s certification period.</p>
  <h2>Processing Delays</h2>
  <p>If the County is unable to complete the certification process by the end of the current certification period, regardless of the cause of the delay, the County may allow for delayed processing of the TNB Program recertification. The delay may be for no more than the calendar month following the end of the certification period. If the household continues to be eligible for the TNB Program, the County will issue benefits for the first full month of the new certification period. The household must be provided notice of approval no later than the last day of the calendar month following the end of the household’s certification period.</p>
  <p class="Note">Reminder: TNB Program benefits cannot be prorated regardless of the cause of the delay. TNB Program benefits should be provided for the full month in which the delay occurred, and that month will be considered the first month in the TNB Program household’s new six-month certification period.</p>
  <h2>California Residency</h2>
  <p>If the TNB 4 is submitted by a household and indicates a current address outside of California, the household will lose TNB program eligibility. At that time, the household must be informed of the TNB Program discontinuance. The County must send the household a TNB 6.</p>
  <h2>Complete TNB 4 Submitted with No Changes Reported</h2>
  <p>If the household does not report any changes, the recertification is considered complete if the household submits the TNB 4 by the due date. Upon receipt of a complete TNB 4 with no changes reported by the household, the EW:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Determines continuing TNB Program eligibility;</li>
    <li>Authorizes TNB Program benefits If found eligible;</li>
    <li>Sends a Notice of Approval for the Transitional Nutrition Benefit Program (TNB 2) to the household.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Complete TNB 4 with No changes Reported and CalFresh Application</h2>
  <p>If the household submits a complete TNB 4 with no changes reported and also submits a CalFresh application, the EW must:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Process both the TNB 4 and the CalFresh application and determine CalFresh eligibility.</li>
    <li>Issue the first month of the new TNB certification period without delay if EW is unable to process the CalFresh application and to determine eligibility within the last month of the TNB Program certification period.</li>
    <li>Process and determine CalFresh eligibility as soon as possible. If the household is eligible for CalFresh, TNB will be discontinued.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Complete TNB 4 Submitted with Changes Reported</h2>
  <p>If the household reports changes by checking “Yes” to any of the questions in Section 1 of TNB 4, the household must submit a complete TNB 4 and a CalFresh application by the due date. Upon receipt of a complete TNB 4 with changes reported by the household, the EW:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Confirms that a CalFresh application has also been submitted by the TNB Program household.</li>
    <li>Processes the CalFresh application including the interview and collect necessary verifications if applicable to determine CalFresh eligibility.</li>
    <li>Discontinue TNB only if the household is found CalFresh eligible.</li>
    <li>Determines whether the household continues to be eligible for the TNB Program if the household is found to remain ineligible for CalFresh.</li>
    <li>Issues TNB Program benefits for the first month of the new TNB Program certification period.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="Note">Note: The household may submit the CalFresh application at the same time as the TNB 4 or may submit a CalFresh application separate from the TNB 4 (e.g., Online, by mail, by phone, by fax, or at the County drop-box), but before the due date.</p>
  <h3>Household Eligible for CalFresh</h3>
  <p>If the household is eligible for CalFresh, the EW:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Approves CalFresh benefits and discontinue TNB Program benefits.</li>
    <li>Sends a TNB 6 to inform the household of the TNB discontinuance.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Household Remains Ineligible for CalFresh</h3>
  <p>If the household continues to meet the TNB Program eligibility requirements, the EW:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Processed the recertification;</li>
    <li>Issues a TNB 2 to inform the household of continuing TNB eligibility and benefit allotments.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="Note">Note: As long as the household remains eligible for TNB, the household receives the same benefit allotments. The initial TNB allotment should not be adjusted even if the household has a change in the household composition.</p>
  <p class="Note">Exception: If the household does not meet the TNB Program eligibility requirements, the household will lose TNB Program eligibility, even if the household is not CalFresh eligible. The TNB 6 must be sent to the household to inform of the TNB Program discontinuance.</p>
  <h2>Incomplete TNB 4 Submitted</h2>
  <p>A TNB 4 is considered incomplete if</p>
  <ol>
    <li>The household does not indicate whether changes have occurred,</li>
    <li>The household does not sign the TNB 4, or</li>
    <li>The household indicates that a change has occurred, but the household does not complete a CalFresh application by the due date.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>If the County receives an incomplete TNB 4, the EW must send the household a Recertification R<em>eminder Notice for the Transitional Nutrition Benefit Program</em> (TNB 5) informing the household that their TNB Program recertification is incomplete.</p>
  <p>If after sending the TNB 5, the County still does not receive a complete TNB 4 and, if applicable, a CalFresh application, the household will lose TNB Program eligibility. In this case, a TNB 6 is not required to be sent to the household, since the TNB 4 is both the TNB Program notice of expiring certification and the TNB Program recertification form.</p>
  <p>If the County receives a complete TNB 4 and, if applicable, a CalFresh application before the end of the certification period, but the delay renders the County unable to complete the recertification timely, the recertification may be completed under TNB Program delayed processing rules. As a reminder, the TNB Program delayed processing may be for no more than a calendar month after the end of the certification period, and TNB Program benefits cannot be prorated.</p>
  <h2>No TNB 4 Submitted</h2>
  <p>If the County does not receive a TNB 4 by the due date, the County will send the household a TNB 5 informing the household that the TNB 4 was not submitted, and the TNB Program recertification is incomplete. If the County does not receive a complete TNB 4 by the end of the certification period, the household will lose TNB Program eligibility. ATNB 6 is not required to be sent to the household since the TNB 4 is both the TNB Program notice of expiring certification and the TNB Program recertification form.</p>

  <p class="Note">Note: If the household is eligible for CalFresh, TNB must be discontinued even if the CalFresh benefit amount is less than the TNB amount.</p>
  <h2><a id="TNBPrgmRestrtn"></a>TNB Program Restorations</h2>
  <p>Once a household loses TNB Program eligibility, TNB Program eligibility cannot be restored. The only exception to this rule is if a household loses TNB Program eligibility for failure to provide the documentation or information required to determine continuing eligibility. In this case, TNB Program eligibility may be restored without proration back to the original date of discontinuance, if all documentation and information required to determine continuing eligibility are provided to the County within 90 days of the discontinuance from the TNB Program.</p>
  <h2><a id="TNBPrgmOther"></a>TNB Program and Other Assistance Program Reporting Requirements</h2>
  <p>Some TNB Program households may also receive other public assistance program benefits, such as CalWORKs. The eligibility requirements for the TNB Program and other public assistance programs are separate and apart from each other. Therefore, if a household receives both TNB Program benefits and other public assistance program benefits, the household must independently meet both sets of requirements to maintain eligibility for each program.</p>
  <p><a class="dropspot" data-rhwidget="DropSpot" data-target="drop-down" href="#"><span data-open-text="true" data-skip-index="true">Example</span><span data-close-text="true">Example</span></a></p>
  <div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop-down">
    <p>If a household is required to submit a SAR 7 for CalWORKs, the TNB recertification form cannot substitute for the SAR 7. The household must complete both the CalWORKs SAR 7 and the TNB Program recertification.</p>
  </div>
  <h2><a id="TNBPrgmICT"></a>TNB Program and Inter-County Transfers</h2>
  <p>The TNB Program benefits are subject to ICT policies and procedures. At the time of an ICT, the TNB Program case must be transferred to the TNB Program household’s new County of residence. The TNB Program benefits will not be terminated because of the ICT.</p>
  <h2>TNB Program Voluntary Request to Close Case</h2>
  <p>Any TNB Program household may voluntarily request to close their TNB Program case at any time. When the County receives a voluntary request to close a TNB Program case from the head of household, responsible adult household member, or authorized representative, the County is required to take mid-period action with no further verification.</p>
  <h2><a id="AidPaidPndg"></a>Aid Paid Pending</h2>
  <p>TNB Program households can request a state hearing on an adverse action such as an O/I claim; however, aid paid pending cannot be granted. If the hearing decision outcome determines that the County was incorrect in their O/I claim, the County must issue a supplemental payment to correct any loss of benefits.</p>

  <p>The following forms are created for the TNB Program and are available in CalSAWS and DEBS Forms Library:</p>
  <h3>TNB 1: Informational Notice for the Transitional Nutrition Benefit Program</h3>
  <p>The TNB 1 is to provide the household with general information about the TNB Program and an overview of TNB Program eligibility rules. The TNB 1 is provided to the household when initial TNB Program eligibility is determined.</p>
  <h3>TNB 2: Notice of Approval for the Transitional Nutrition Benefit</h3>
  <p>This form is to inform the household that they have been approved for the TNB. This notice also provides information to the household about how they may continue to receive TNB. The TNB 2 is proved to the household when initial TNB program eligibility is determined and the TNB Program recertification, if applicable.</p>
  <h3>TNB 3: Notice of Change for the Transitional Nutrition Benefit</h3>
  <p>This form is to inform the household that there has been a change in their TNB (for example, if TNB Program funding changes and TNB Program benefit allotments are impacted). The TNB 3 must be provided to the household no later than ten days prior to the change.</p>
  <h3>TNB 4: Notice of Recertification for the Transitional Nutrition Benefit</h3>
  <p>This form is to inform the household the household’s TNB Program certification will expire and that the household must complete the TNB Program recertification process to continue receiving TNB. The TNB 4 serves as both the notice of expiring certification and the TNB Program recertification form.</p>
  <p>The TNB 4 indicates the date the household’s TNB Program certification period expires. It also provides the date by which the household must submit the TNB Program recertification form and, if applicable, a CalFresh application to receive uninterrupted TNB. The TNB 4 describes that not completing the recertification on time may lead to a discontinuance. The TNB 4 explains that household that no longer resides in California are not eligible for TNB Program and therefore do not need to complete the TNB Program recertification.</p>
  <p>The TNB 4 requires that the TNB household report any changes that may make the household ineligible for the TNB Program. If the TNB household reports such a change, the TNB 4 informs the household that they must also submit a CalFresh application. The TNB 4 must be sent at least 45 days in advance of the household’s expiration of TNB Program certification. The Application for CalFresh Benefits (CF 285) can be sent with the TNB 4.</p>
  <h3>TNB 5: Reminder Notice for the Transitional Nutrition Benefit Program</h3>
  <p>This form is to inform the household that their TNB recertification was either not received or is incomplete. If the TNB RC is incomplete, the TNB 5 informs the household of what is required to complete the RC process. This form reminds the household that the County cannot complete the RC process until all required steps have been taken by the household.</p>
  <h3>TNB 6: Notice of Discontinuance for the Transitional Nutrition Benefit Program</h3>
  <p>This form is to inform the household that the household’s TNB Program eligibility has been discontinued. This form must be provided to the household no later than ten days prior to the discontinuance unless the discontinuance is a result of an incomplete TNB Program RC. TNB 6 does not need to be sent when the TNB household does not submit the TNB 4 (i.e., RC form).</p>
