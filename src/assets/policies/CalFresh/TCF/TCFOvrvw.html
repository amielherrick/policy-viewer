  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <div data-microcontent="CalFresh:intent7">
    <p><a href="#" data-popovertext="Assembly Bill" data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">AB</a> 231 was signed into law which provides Transitional CalFresh benefits to households who are terminating their participation in the CalWORKs program. Transitional CalFresh benefits are designed to help households retain CalFresh benefits after discontinuing from the CalWORKs program to help ensure success in the transition from welfare to work.</p>
  </div>
  <p>Entitlement to Transitional CalFresh benefits is determined by the worker without the household having to apply. Benefits are the same as the amount received by the household prior to its termination from CalWORKs, adjusted for the loss of the CalWORKs grant.</p>
  <p>Households may apply for regular CalFresh during the transitional period. Regular CalFresh benefits will be determined based on their current circumstances, and if approved, Transitional CalFresh benefits will stop and all regular CalFresh requirements will apply.</p>
  <h2>Eligibility</h2>
  <p>A CalFresh <a href="#" data-popovertext="Household" data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">HH</a> who loses CalWORKs cash assistance or Tribal <a href="#" data-popovertext="Temporary Assistance for Needy Families " data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">TANF</a> in “good standing” is eligible to receive Transitional CalFresh benefits for up to<strong> five months </strong>with certain exceptions. Refer to <a href="#Exceptions">Exceptions</a>.  To streamline reference to TCF and CalFresh households, the term “CalWORKs household” refers to both federally funded and state funded CalWORKs AUs, and Tribal TANF.</p>
  <p>A CalFresh HH is eligible to receive Transitional CalFresh when eligibility to CalWORKs cash assistance is lost even if all CalFresh HH members were not receiving CalWORKs cash assistance. At least one CalWORKs member must have received CalFresh and CalWORKs in the month of the CalWORKs discontinuance to qualify for TCF. If an individual CalWORKs household member has been sanctioned, but the remainder of the household continues to receive CalWORKs, then the remaining non-sanctioned household members may receive TCF upon CalWORKs discontinuance. </p>
  <p>CalWORKs households that are <strong>eligible </strong>for TCF include, but are not limited to those discontinued from CalWORKs in good standing due to any of the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Discontinued from CalWORKs due to excess income or property limits for CalWORKs eligibility. The new IRT for CalFresh does not impact TCF rules. If the household is eligible to TCF then changes in income are not considered when determining the amount of benefits the household is eligible to during the TCF benefit period.</li>
    <li>Households that voluntarily requested to close their CalWORKs case.
      <ul>
        <li>Households that request discontinuance of CalWORKs the last month of the current certification period or the SAR 7 submit month are eligible for TCF, even if a discontinuance NOA was issued for failure to complete redetermination or the SAR 7. The reason for the CalWORKs discontinuance must be due to a household’s request to close the case.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The reason the CalWORKs case discontinued is due to a parent timing out or child aging out when that individual was the last eligible person in the household.</li>
    <li>A CalWORKs household that is disqualified due to a CalWORKs rule change.</li>
    <li>If the other county does not approve the CalWORKs ICT, then the household may be eligible for Transitional CalFresh benefits from Santa Clara County for up to five months.</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop-down">
    <p>CalWORKs/CalFresh HH notifies the EW on 04/30/04 that the household has moved out of county. EW sends ICT packet on 04/30/04 and discontinues the CalWORKs and CalFresh benefits effective 05/31/04. On 06/02/04, the EW contacts the other county and is advised the other county did not pick up the ICT since the client failed to show for her interview. Santa Clara County would issue Transitional CalFresh benefits beginning in 06/04 (State PI).</p>
  </div>
  <h2><a id="Exceptions"></a>Exceptions</h2>
  <p>The following households are NOT eligible to receive Transitional CalFresh benefits:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>All CalWORKs household members applied and were approved for <a href="#" data-popovertext="Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program" data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">SNAP</a> and/or TANF benefits in another state.</li>
    <li>A household discontinued from CalWORKs for failing to submit a complete SAR 7.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p class="Note">Note: If a household submits a SAR 7 and fails to meet all of the CalWORKs reporting requirements, but meets the CalFresh requirements, then <a href="#" data-popovertext="Eligibility Worker" data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">EW</a>s must evaluate the household’s ongoing eligibility for CalFresh.

            <p>If the household submits the SAR 7 in the month following the discontinuance from CalWORKs, effectively restoring the CalWORKs case, then the household would be converted back to PACF and CalFresh benefits adjusted for the inclusion of the CalWORKs grant with a timely and adequate notice.</p>
