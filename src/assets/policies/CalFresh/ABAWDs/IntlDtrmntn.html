  <h1><span data-field="title" data-format="default">Initial Determination</span></h1>
  <p>An initial determination is required for:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>All applicants to determine if they meet the definition of an <a href="#" data-popovertext="Able Bodied Adult Without Dependents" data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">ABAWD</a> at the time of application. This includes individuals who received CalFresh from another county or state.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p class="Note">Note: Once an individual’s ABAWD period has begun, that individual remains an ABAWD calendar regardless of whether that individual later becomes exempt, or is discontinued, and subsequently reapplies.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>All individuals who do not meet the definition of an ABAWD at the time of application but who later do so because of a change in circumstances.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Potential ABAWDs</h2>
  <p>A potential ABAWD household includes an individual who can be reasonably anticipated to become an ABAWD at some point within the certification period. An existing ABAWD household includes an individual who is clearly an ABAWD at the time of certification.</p>
  <p><a class="dropspot" data-rhwidget="DropSpot" data-target="drop-down" href="#"><span data-open-text="true" data-skip-index="true">Example</span><span data-close-text="true">Example</span></a></p>
  <div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop-down">
    <p>A household composed of a 40-year-old, able-bodied mother and her 17 year old, able-bodied son is an example of a potential ABAWD household. The EW should advise such a household that both members will become subject to the time limit when the person turns 18, at which point each household members’ eligibility for CalFresh will be limited to three months if they are not fulfilling the ABAWD work requirement or otherwise exempt. The EW should also advise that the household should contact its eligibility worker if a household member starts fulfilling the ABAWD work requirements or experiences a change that would exempt them from the time limit. It is the household’s responsibility to report changes that may exempt them from the time limit mid-certification period.</p>
  </div>
  <h2>Informing Requirements</h2>
  <p>An individual cannot be considered an ABAWD, be subject to the time limit, or be required to make a mandatory mid-period report of a drop in ABAWD work hours until they have been informed of the ABAWD time limit rules. Individuals who are not informed of the ABAWD time limit rules (at initial certification, periodic report, or recertification) cannot be held accountable for reporting changes in their circumstances that may cause them to become subject to the time limit mid-period.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The EW must inform ABAWD and potential ABAWD households of the time limit, exemption criteria (including exemptions from the general work requirements), and how to fulfill the ABAWD work requirement, as these rules and responsibilities are fundamental to their eligibility for CalFresh. At a minimum, this must take place during the eligibility interview.</li>
    <li>ABAWD households must be informed of the requirement to report whenever their work hours fall below 20 hours per week, averaged monthly. This requirement must be explained to the household both verbally and in writing at application and recertification.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="Important">Important: When processing a CalFresh application as <a href="#" data-popovertext="Expedited Services " data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">ES</a>, verification for the ABAWD eligibility may be postponed until the 30th day after the application date.</p>
  <h2><a id="ContinuingElig"></a>Continuing Eligibility</h2>
  <p>Some changes in circumstances which may affect the ABAWD status during the certification include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Child turns 18 years of age,</li>
    <li>Pregnant woman miscarries,</li>
    <li>Unemployment Insurance Benefits end,</li>
    <li>Medical exemption expires, or</li>
    <li>Student drops out of school.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Changes occur during the certification may or may not require mid period action:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>When a person loses an exemption due to a change in circumstances which is subject to <a href="#" data-popovertext="Semi-Annual Reporting " data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">SAR</a> reporting requirements, a determination of his/her ABAWD status must be made when the change is reported.</li>
    <li>When a person loses his/her exemption status due to a change in circumstances which is not subject to reporting requirements, he/she remains exempt from work registration and the ABAWD work requirement until SAR 7 or recertification.</li>
    <li>When a change of ABAWD status is known to county at the intake or recertification (i.e. child reaching 18 years of age), a determination of his/her ABAWD exemption status must be updated mid period.</li>
    <li>If a temporary exemption is granted, the <a href="#" data-popovertext="Eligibility Worker" data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">EW</a> must follow up with the household at the anticipated end date of the exemption. If there was no end date, the exemption status can be reviewed at the SAR 7 or <a href="#" data-popovertext="Recertification " data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">RC</a>, whichever occurs first.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Mandatory ABAWD Mid-Period Reports</h3>
  <p>Under simplified reporting, recipients are mandated to report specified changes to the county within 10 calendar days of the date the change. The county shall document any required reports made by the household, including the date of the report, in the case file. ABAWD households have two required mid-period reports:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Gross monthly income received over the <a href="#" data-popovertext="Income Reporting Threshold " data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">IRT</a>; and</li>
    <li>A reduction in ABAWD work hours below 20 hours per week, averaged monthly.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>The second mandatory mid-period reporting requirement only applies to ABAWDs subject to the time limit living in counties or areas that do not have a waiver of the ABAWD time limit. As long as households meet the work requirement (20/80 hours), they are not required to report the hours they have worked during mid period.</p>
  <p class="Exception">Exception: A reduction in the number of hours in unpaid county-supervised work activities, such as workfare, will not be subject to mandatory recipient mid-period reporting as this information is known to the county.</p>
  <p>All non-waiver counties must act on reported reductions in ABAWD work hours mid-period. Upon receipt of a mandatory mid-period report, the EW must first determine if the individual:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Is subject to the time limit,</li>
    <li>Qualifies for an exemption from the time limit,</li>
    <li>Satisfied the work requirement,</li>
    <li>Met good cause criteria, or</li>
    <li>Received an exemption.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If none of these are true, the EW must determine whether the reduction in work hours will result in:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Application of a countable month;</li>
    <li>Discontinuance due to exhaustion of the three countable months;</li>
    <li>Use of the three consecutive months (i.e. for those that have regained eligibility); or</li>
  </ol>
  <p>If a discontinuance or sanction is appropriate, the EW shall take action to reduce or discontinue benefits at the end of the month in which timely and adequate 10-day notice can be provided.</p>
  <h3>Changes Not Required to be Reported</h3>
  <p>Changes may occur in a household’s circumstances mid-period that are not required to be reported to the County. When a change that is not required to be reported occurs and causes an individual to become subject to the ABAWD time limit, the County must apply ABAWD time limit rules from the date that the County becomes aware of the change.</p>
  <p>When the EW becomes aware of the change, the EW must:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Screen the individual for exemptions from the ABAWD time limit;</li>
    <li>Establish whether they are satisfying the ABAWD work requirement; and</li>
    <li>Begin assigning countable months of benefits if necessary.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Restoration of Benefits</h3>
  <p>When a household is discontinued due to an incomplete SAR 7 or for failure to submit the SAR 7, but the household resolves the issue within the restoration period, the County may restore eligibility to the household without a new application. For an ABAWD to be eligible to a restoration they must provide verification they are eligible to receive CalFresh (i.e. satisfied the work requirement, qualified for an exemption, or had good cause).</p>
  <p>Within the month following the discontinuance, the household is required to provide the required verification to resolve the discontinuance. Before restoring benefits, the household must meet all other eligibility requirements. Once the information is verified by the EW, eligibility will be restored, and benefits will be prorated from the date the discontinuance is resolved.</p>
  <h3>County Initiated Mid Period Actions</h3>
  <p>Certain changes in household circumstances are not required to report until SAR 7 or recertification. However, changes that affect the household’s ABAWD time limit that is known to the County, the EW must evaluate the ABAWD status, and a county initiated action must be taken mid-period. For example, an ABAWD was exempt from the time limit because his/her household consists of a child under 18 at the time of certification. When the child turns 18, the child and the ABAWDs become subject to the ABAWD work requirement effective the first of following month the child’s 18th birthday.</p>
  <p><a class="dropspot" data-rhwidget="DropSpot" data-target="drop-down1" href="#"><span data-open-text="true" data-skip-index="true">Example</span><span data-close-text="true">Example</span></a></p>
  <div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop-down1">
    <p>A household consists of a mother age 41 and son age 17. At the time of certification, both members are exempt from the ABAWD time limit solely because the son is under 18. The household is assigned a 12-month certification period. The household is not required to report when the son becomes 18 years old. When the son turns 18 in June, both he and his mother become ABAWDs and are subject to the time limit, but the SAR 7 is not due until September. When the SAR 7 is reviewed in September, the EW discovers that both the mother and the son are ABAWDS and have been since July 1. SAR does not require the household to report the son’s 18th birthday mid period, the projected change is already known to the county at certification. Unless the mother and son report and verify that they have begun fulling the ABAWD work requirement, report a change that qualifies them for exemption from the time limit, are granted individual exemption, July, August, and September would be three countable months. An adequate and timely discontinuance NOA must be sent.</p>
  </div>
  <p>If the county receives information that is considered <a href="#" data-popovertext="verified upon receipt " data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">VUR</a> and impacts an individual’s work registration status or ABAWD status, the EW must take action to register the individual for employment within 10 days of the date the change is reported. If it is determined that the individual is an ABAWD subject tot he time limit, the EW must inform the household of ABAWD time limit rules and reporting requirements and begin tracking the individual as an ABAWD subject to the time limit.</p>
  <h3>Periodic Report and Recertification for CalFresh Benefits</h3>
  <p>The County will continue to use the information reported on the SAR 7 Eligibility Status Report or CF 37 Recertification for CalFresh Benefits to determine continuing eligibility and future benefit amounts based on all eligibility factors for ABAWDs.</p>
  <h3>Informing Requirements during RRR</h3>
  <p>ABAWD households must be informed of the requirement to report whenever their work hours fall below 20 hours per week, averaged monthly. This requirement must be explained to the household both verbally and in writing at application and recertification.</p>
  <h3>Overissuance (O/I)</h3>
  <p>If a non-reportable change occurs that causes a person to be subject to the ABAWD time limit, the county must start the three countable months from the date the County knows the individual is an ABAWD and subject to the time limit. No O/I claim can be established.</p>
  <p><a class="dropspot" data-rhwidget="DropSpot" data-target="drop-down2" href="#"><span data-open-text="true" data-skip-index="true">Example</span><span data-close-text="true">Example</span></a></p>
  <div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop-down2">
    <p>A household applied for CalFresh on April 3rd and is not subject to the ABAWD time limit due to a child under the age of 18 residing in the home. On May 17th, the child leaves the home, but this is not reported. When the SAR 7 is submitted in September, the EW discovered that the household reported that the child had left home. The individual’s ABAWD months are June, July, and August. The household was not required to report the change until the six-month report was submitted; therefore, an overissuance does not exist for September.</p>
