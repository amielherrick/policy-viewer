  <h1><span data-field="title" data-format="default">Losing Eligibility</span></h1>
  <p>An <a href="#" data-popovertext="Able Bodied Adult Without Dependents" data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">ABAWD</a> who has exhausted their three countable months during the 36-month period and is not otherwise exempt is ineligible for CalFresh benefits. The individual shall remain ineligible for the remainder of the 36-month period unless they regain eligibility, qualify for an ABAWD exemption, or move to a waived county or area.</p>
  <p>The <a href="#" data-popovertext="Eligibility Worker" data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">EW</a> must discontinue an ABAWD’s CalFresh benefits with timely and adequate notice if they have exhausted their three countable months and reached the time limit. The EW must send the Notice of Discontinuance for Failure to Meet the ABAWD Work Requirement (CF 377.11) informing the client of the discontinuance and explaining how the client may regain eligibility. This notice must be sent no later than 10 days after the ABAWD individual reports a drop in work hours or the county becomes aware they are no longer satisfying the work requirement.</p>
  <p>ABAWDs subject to the time limit have an additional mandatory reporting requirement and must inform the county of a reduction in work hours below 20 hours per week (averaged monthly) within 10 days of the date the drop in work hours became known to the household.</p>
  <p>If it is discovered that a client has used their third countable month and the next month of benefits has already been issued, the county may determine that the ABAWD had good cause for failure to satisfy the work requirement; assign an exemption for the month following the third countable month. In these instances, the EW must notify the client their case will be discontinued effective the following month.</p>
  <p class="Note">Note: In the event the EW is already aware that the client is not satisfying the work requirement, and has received their third countable month, the EW has flexibility to send the <a href="#" data-popovertext="Notice of Action " data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">NOA</a> in the third countable month to provide the household more time to respond. If the client later reports that they did in fact satisfy the work requirement, the third countable month can be retroactively removed.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p class="Note">Note: There will be some cases where a client will receive a discontinuance NOA in month 3 and others where a client will receive their NOA in month 4. The EW must send the Notice of Discontinuance for Failure to Meet the ABAWD Work Requirement at least 10 days prior to case closure, but the EW has flexibility to send it sooner to provide the household more time to respond.</p>
  <p class="Note">In the event the client reports a drop in work hours after CalFresh benefits have been issued and all three countable months have been used, the NOA should be sent no later than 10 days following the date of the mandatory report. This discontinuance NOA will be sent in the fourth month because the ABAWD is allowed 10 days after the end of the month to make a mandatory report of a drop in work hours for the prior month.</p>
  <p>If the ABAWD individual has been discontinued and is no longer eligible for benefits, he/she is now considered an ineligible household member. Such individuals shall be excluded when determining the size of the CalFresh household. The entirety of their resources and a prorated share of their income shall be used when calculating the household’s CalFresh allotment.</p>
  <p class="Note">Note: In CalFresh households of more than one, benefits are only discontinued for the ABAWD member who is subject to the time limit and failed to satisfy the work requirement, not the entire household.</p>
  <h2>Administrative Hearings</h2>
  <p>The following procedures apply if an ABAWD requests an administrative hearing:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The 36-month period is paused by removing the third countable month and benefits will continue until there is a hearing decision;</li>
    <li>If the hearing decision is in the county’s favor, the original third countable month is counted and the case will close (if there are no other eligible members) and an overissuance will be established for any CalFresh benefits received in error following the third countable month; or</li>
    <li>If the hearing decision is in the client’s favor, benefits received are retained and the EW must review ABAWD participation status for ongoing months.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2><a id="Regain"></a>Regaining Eligibility</h2>
  <p>An individual who is discontinued for failure to satisfy the ABAWD work requirement shall remain ineligible until they satisfy requirements for regaining eligibility. There is no limit on the number of times a client may regain eligibility within the 36-month period.</p>
  <p>ABAWDs subject to the time limit who have exhausted their three countable months may regain eligibility at any time if they:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Satisfy the ABAWD work requirement for any consecutive 30-day period;</li>
    <li>Qualify for an ABAWD exemption for any part of the month;</li>
    <li>Move to a waiver area; or</li>
    <li>Reach the end of the 36-month period.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>A new application is required for ABAWD households of one to regain eligibility for CalFresh. Once an ABAWD has regained eligibility for CalFresh, benefits must be prorated from the date of application, for households of one. If an ABAWD is requesting their CalFresh benefits be reinstated on an existing case, the EW must follow current policy to add a new household member. The EW shall take action to add the ABAWD effective the first day of the month following the month in which the request for CalFresh benefits was made after all verification has been provided.</p>
  <p>If an individual regains eligibility through employment or other qualifying work activity, they must provide verification they satisfied the ABAWD work requirement in a consecutive 30-day period. The consecutive 30-day period does not have to immediately precede the date of application.</p>
  <p class="Important">Important: Prospective work hours do not qualify an individual to regain eligibility. In order to regain eligibility by satisfying the work requirement, ABAWDs must have worked for 30 consecutive days at the time of reapplication. A proof of hours worked is required at the time of reapplication.</p>
  <h2><a id="Addtl3Mos"></a>Additional Three Consecutive Months</h2>
  <p>In certain circumstances, ABAWDs may be granted an additional three consecutive months of eligibility after they have exhausted their three countable months. This only applies to ABAWDs who have regained eligibility by satisfying the work requirement for any 30 consecutive calendar days, but have subsequently stopped satisfying the work requirement. This policy allows the client to be given three additional months of benefits to be used consecutively.</p>
  <p class="Note">Note: Once the first of the three consecutive months is issued, the other two months will automatically follow even if the ABAWD satisfies the work requirement during that time. The three consecutive months of eligibility are only available once during the 36-month period and must be given to those ABAWD clients who qualify (i.e. by regaining eligibility and subsequently not satisfying the work requirement).</p>
  <p>If an individual ABAWD has used their three countable months, lost eligibility, and then regains eligibility by satisfying the work requirement, the three consecutive months will start when the ABAWD notifies the county that they are no longer satisfying the work requirement. <strong>If the individual was participating in a work program or workfare program, the three consecutive months will start when the county determines the ABAWD is no longer in compliance. </strong>Counties must track the three consecutive months in the ABAWD’s individual record of the 36-month period in MEDS. An example of the use of the three consecutive months is illustrated below.</p>
  <p><a class="dropspot" data-rhwidget="DropSpot" data-target="drop-down" href="#"><span data-open-text="true" data-skip-index="true">Example</span><span data-close-text="true">Example</span></a></p>
  <div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop-down">
    <p>An ABAWD subject to the time limit fails to satisfy the work requirement during months 2, 3 and 4 of the 36-month period and is ineligible for CalFresh. In month 7, the client obtains employment, meets the work requirement, and regains eligibility. At the beginning of month eight, the client loses his job. The ABAWD individual is eligible receive the additional three consecutive months of CalFresh benefits for months 8, 9 and 10 without satisfying the work requirement. Beginning with month 11 and for the remaining months of the 36-month period, the client can only receive CalFresh if they satisfy the ABAWD work requirement or qualify for an exemption. This example is illustrated in the following table.</p>
  </div>
  <p class="Note">Note: In the example above, because there is no partial month applied in June or July, it is assumed that the client applied for and received a full month of CalFresh benefits on the first day of July. This person’s 30 consecutive day period began no later than June 1. When they submitted their application on July 1st, they provided proof that they had satisfied the work requirement for 30 consecutive days.</p>
  <p>If the ABAWD reapplying for benefits in July is a part of an existing CalFresh household, the ABAWD can be added to the case effective the first day of the month (i.e.Aug). Using this calendar, the client would be assigned tracking code “9” for July because they are not receiving any aid.</p>
