  <h1><span data-field="title" data-format="default">Tracking ABAWD Participation</span></h1>
  <p>Counties must track an <a href="#" data-popovertext="Able Bodied Adult Without Dependents" data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">ABAWD</a>s eligibility and participation for each month in the 36-month period. The ABAWD time clock available in CalSAWS must be used.</p>
  <h2>Tracking ABAWDs in the Fixed 36-Month Period</h2>
  <p>Individuals exempt from the ABAWD time limit are not tracked until they become subject to the time limit and are no longer exempt.</p>
  <p>Once tracking an ABAWD subject to the time limit has been initiated, it must continue for the remainder of the 36-month period. This includes periods of time when the individual is residing in a waived area or temporarily meets the criteria for an exemption.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Refer to the <a href="https://web.calsaws.net/c-iv/webcontent/onlineHelp/web_help/utilities_homepage.htm#t=ja_abawd.htm&amp;rhsearch=ABAWD%20time%20limit&amp;ux=search">ABAWD Job Aid</a> for additional guidance related to ABAWD in CalSAWS.</p>
  <h2><a id="montlyengage"></a>ABAWD Monthly Engagement</h2>
  <p>At Intake, SAR 7, recertification, or as soon as the EW becomes aware that an ABAWD subject to time limit does not satisfy the work requirement, the county must begin monthly engagement with the ABAWD and apply the strategies described in this section. In addition to the engagement notices described below, the EW may attempt to contact the client by phone or electronic means and encourage them to contact the county for assistance in satisfying the work requirement.</p>
  <h3>CalFresh Employment &amp; Training Program (CFET)</h3>
  <p>As part of engagement strategies, The <a href="#" data-popovertext="Santa Clara County " data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">SCC</a> offers <a href="#" data-popovertext="CalFresh Employment and Training " data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">CFET</a> to CalFresh recipients including ABAWDs subject to time limit. For more information on CFET and the referral process, Refer to <a href="../CFET/Introduction.html">CALFRESH EMPLOYMENT &amp; TRAINING (CFET)</a>.</p>
  <h3>Certification Period and Monthly Engagement Examples</h3>
  <p>The tables below provide examples of the ABAWD certification period policy and ABAWD eligibility rules<br/>

  <p><strong>12 Month Certification Period – Consecutive Use of Countable Months</strong></p>
  <p>The client applies after the first of th month in month 1. The household receives a partial benefit allotment which is not countable toward the three month time limit. The ABAWD is not working at application and receives three countable moths for months two through four. The discontinuance notice was sent timely and CalFresh benefits were discontinued effective the first of the following month.</p>

    <p>The client applied for CalFresh in January and used the countable months from February to April. The client made a mandatory mid-period report of a drop in work hours at the beginning of May (month 5) within 10 days of the occurrence. The client’s CalFresh benefits had already been issued for May and the discontinuance notice was mailed by the 10 days. Apply a percentage exemption in May to avid OI if appropriate.</p>

  <h2><a id="letters"></a>ABAWD Informing Letters and Notices</h2>
  <h3>CF 377.11 CalFresh Time Limit Notice – Failure to Meet the Able-Bodied Adults Without Dependents (ABAWDs) Work Requirement</h3>
  <p>The purpose of the CF 377.11 is to inform the client that they will be discontinued from receiving CalFresh after failing to satisfy the ABAWD work requirement for three full countable months during the 36-month period. This notice also provides instructions to the client on how they may continue to receive CalFresh benefits or regain CalFresh eligibility after discontinuance. This notice must be sent no later than ten days prior to discontinuance.</p>
  <h3>CF 377.11A - CalFresh Time Limit Notice – Expiration of Three Consecutive Months for Able-Bodied Adults Without Dependents (ABAWDs)</h3>
  <p>The purpose of the CF 377.11A is to inform the client that they have been granted the additional three consecutive months of CalFresh benefits available to ABAWDs subject to the time limit. This notice also provides instructions to the client on how they may continue to receive CalFresh benefits or regain CalFresh eligibility. This notice should be sent no later than ten days after the three consecutive months has been granted.</p>
  <h3>CF 377.11B - CalFresh Countable Month Letter – Use of Countable Month for Able-Bodied Adults Without Dependents (ABAWDs)</h3>
  <p>This notice is sent to ABAWDs subject to the time limit who are not satisfying the ABAWD work requirement. Counties must send ABAWDs subject to the time limit, but not satisfying the work requirement, and accruing countable months, this letter for every month the County determines that the ABAWD has received a countable month of benefits, based on the most recent information available.</p>
  <p>This letter informs the household they have received a countable month of benefits toward the ABAWD time limit. Additionally, the countable month letter will include information about how to report a change in circumstances, particularly if the ABAWD has started to satisfy the work requirement and has not informed the county, or is now meeting the criteria for an exemption. The ABAWD Countable Month Letter must be sent for countable months one and two. The CF 377.11B is an informational letter and there is no required client action and no negative action associated with the letter.</p>
  <p>This notice should be sent on or before Notice of Action (NOA) cut off which is 10 days prior to the end of the month when, based on the most recent information available, the County assumes the ABAWD is not satisfying the work requirement and subsequently receives a countable month of CalFresh benefits.</p>
  <h3>CF 377.11C - CalFresh Informational Notice – CalFresh Time Limit for Able-Bodied Adults Without Dependents (ABAWDs)</h3>
  <p>The CF 377.11C is an informational notice that provides ABAWD households and potential ABAWD households with information regarding the ABAWD time limit, ABAWD time limit exemptions and changes to their reporting requirements. This informational notice highlights changes related to the ABAWD time limit. The informational notice does not explain all CalFresh reporting requirements or rules and does not replace any existing notices.</p>
  <p>The County must send the informational notice to all existing CalFresh households with individuals determined to be an ABAWD based on information available to the County in the existing case record at least six months in advance of the County implementing the ABAWD time limit. The informational notice must also be given to all applicant households that apply during the 6-month time period prior to implementation and that includes individuals determined to be an ABAWD based on information provided to the County on the application. The CF 377.11C is an informational notice and there is no required client action and no negative action associated with the notice.</p>
  <h3>ABAWD Work Reminder/Countable Month Letter</h3>
  <p>The Countable Month Letter will be sent to ABAWDs who are subject to the time limit, but not satisfying the work requirement and accruing countable months, based on the most recent information available, that the ABAWD has received a countable month of benefits. This notice informs the household when they have received a countable month of benefits. Additionally, the countable month notice includes information about how to report a change in circumstances, particularly if the ABAWD individual has started to satisfy the work requirement and has not informed the county or is now meeting the criteria for an exemption.</p>
  <p>The <em>ABAWD Countable Month Letter</em> for countable month one and two is an informing notice and there is no required client or negative action associated with the notice.</p>
  <h2><a id="CFAP"></a>California Food Assistance Program (CFAP)</h2>
  <p>California provides state-funded food assistance benefits though <a href="#" data-popovertext="California Food Assistance Program " data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">CFAP</a> for qualified non-citizens who do not qualify for federal CalFresh benefits due to immigration status. Individuals receiving CFAP benefits are also subject to the ABAWD time limit rules.<br/>
    If a CFAP recipient begins receiving federal CalFresh benefits during the 36-month period, ABAWD status will be reassessed at that time. The ABAWD individual’s eligibility for CalFresh will be “<strong>reset</strong>” and the individual ABAWD will be subject to the time limit as a recipient of federal CalFresh benefits, unless they are otherwise exempt.</p>
  <p>When the individual becomes a recipient of federal CalFresh benefits, the ABAWD will receive a <em>new set of three countable months</em>, regardless of whether they lost eligibility due to reaching the ABAWD time limit as a CFAP recipient. A new individual ABAWD record of the 36-month period will be established in MEDS.</p>
  <h3>CFAP Percentage Exemptions</h3>
  <p>CFAP recipients are not eligible to received federally-funded percentage exemptions. However, individuals at risk of losing state-funded CFAP benefits due to not meeting the work requirements may receive a state-funded, CFAP specific, percentage exemption.</p>
  <p>CFAP ABAWDs who are granted a CFAP percentage exemption are temporarily excused from satisfying the work requirement (i.e. for one month). ABAWDs excused from satisfying the work requirement under the CFAP percentage exemption remain subject to ABAWD time limit rules and must satisfy the work requirement unless become exempt.</p>
