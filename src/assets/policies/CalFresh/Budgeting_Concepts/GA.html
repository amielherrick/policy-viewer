  <p>These funds may be classified as a resource, excluded income, unearned income, or any excluded charitable contribution depending on the situation.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Funds given directly to the household as a one-time lump sum payment are counted as a resource.
      <ul>
        <li>Refer to <a href="../Resources/ReqLimit.html">Resources [63-501]</a> for further details.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Funds disbursed as a vendor payment for rent, clothing, etc., are considered excluded income. HOWEVER, ANY EXPENSES PAID WITH A VENDOR PAYMENT SHALL NOT BE ALLOWED AS A DEDUCTION.
      <ul>
        <li>Refer to <a href="../Income_Definitions_and_Exemptions/VndrPymts.html">Vendor Payments</a> for further details.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Funds given directly to the household in more than one payment (not in a one-time lump sum payment), are counted as unearned income in the month(s) received.</li>
    <li>If the funds are charitable cash contributions, the funds would be excluded income up to $300 per calendar period. Funds exceeding that amount per period would be counted as unearned income.
      <ul>
        <li>Refer to <a href="../Income_Definitions_and_Exemptions/ChrtblContrbutn.html">Charitable Contributions</a> for further details.</li>

  <h2><a id="Boarders"></a>Boarders [63-402.3]</h2>
  <h3>Definition</h3>
  <p>Refer to <a href="../Household_Composition/Definitions.html">Household Composition</a> for the definition and household composition treatment of a boarder.</p>
  <h3>Budgeting</h3>
  <p>Boarders may be included as members of the CalFresh household at the household&#39;s request. The income and other circumstances of the boarder must then be included in determining the household&#39;s eligibility and benefits.</p>
  <p>An individual who pays less than reasonable compensation to the household which provides him/her with meals and lodging will be considered a member of that household. His/her income and other circumstances must be included when determining the household&#39;s eligibility and benefits.</p>
  <p><a class="dropspot" data-rhwidget="DropSpot" data-target="drop-down" href="#"><span data-open-text="true" data-skip-index="true">Example</span><span data-close-text="true">Example</span></a></p>
  <div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop-down">
    <p>A boarder living with a CalFresh household pays $100 monthly for room and board. If the Thrifty Food Plan for one person is $162, then the boarder is considered a member of that CalFresh household</p>
  </div>
  <p>When the boarder is not included as a household member, the payment that the boarder gives to the household for lodging and meals shall be treated as self-employed earned income to the household, after deducting the amount of the Thrifty Food Plan as an expense.</p>
  <p><a class="dropspot" data-rhwidget="DropSpot" data-target="drop-down1" href="#"><span data-open-text="true" data-skip-index="true">Example</span><span data-close-text="true">Example</span></a></p>
  <div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop-down1">
    <p>A boarder living with a CalFresh household pays $200 monthly for room and board. If the Thrifty Food Plan for one person is $162, then the income to the CalFresh household shall be computed as follows:</p>
    <p>$200 Room and board payment<br/>
      <u>–$162</u> Thrifty Food Plan allotment for one person<br/>
      $38 Net self-employment earnings counted on the CalFresh budget.
    </p>
    <p>Apply the 20% earned income deduction to the net self-employment earnings.</p>
  </div>
  <h2>Foster Children</h2>
  <p>Foster children are considered boarders and should be excluded from the CalFresh household as non-household members, unless the household specifically requests that they be included:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If the foster child is included in the CalFresh household at the household&#39;s request, count the entire Foster Care grant as income to the household.</li>
    <li>If the household does not choose to include the foster child as a household member, none of his/her income is counted toward the CalFresh household.</li>
    <li>The foster child who is considered a boarder is not required to pay reasonable compensation to the household.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="Note">Note: This applies to children in receipt of Kin GAP as well.</p>
