    <li>

  <h2>The Medical Improvement Not Expected (MINE) List*</h2>
  <p>The MINE list, developed by the <a href="#" data-popovertext="Social Security Administration " data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">SSA</a>, applies to individuals with impairments in which no improvement is expected. These are extremely severe impairments determined on the basis of experience in administering the disability programs to be at least static, but more likely to be progressively disabling either by reason of the impairment itself or impairment complications and which are unlikely to improve. Impairments which currently are not expected to improve are listed below.</p>

  <h2>Felony Drug Conviction</h2>
  <p><a href="#" data-popovertext="Assembly Bill" data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">AB</a> 1468 repeals the existing prohibition from receipt of CalWORKs and CalFresh benefits for individuals convicted in state or federal court after December 31, 1997 of a dug related felony. AB 1468 enacts statutory changes to the CalWORKs and CalFresh programs so that individuals with a prior felony drug conviction become eligible to receive benefits, so long as the individual is compliant with the terms of his or her probation or parole. With the enactment of AB 1468, individuals with a prior felony drug convictions are eligible for CalFresh benefits effective April 1, 2015.</p>
  <p>Applicants and recipients with prior felony drug convictions must be in compliance with the terms of their parole or probation in order to be eligible to receive CalFresh benefits. Therefore, any member who has found by a court of law to be in violation of probation or parole is ineligible for CalFresh.</p>
  <h3>Intake process</h3>
  <p>When applicants and recipients declare in the CalFresh application that no member of their household is found by a court of law to be in violation of probation or parole, no other verification is required.</p>
  <h3>Continuing process</h3>
  <p>Households who do not request assistance for a drug felon in their household, must be reviewed for possible eligibility during their recertification. If the drug felon is eligible, they must be added to the CalFresh household on the first of the month following the discovery of eligibility.</p>
  <p>When recipients are in violation of the terms of their parole or probation, they must be discontinued from the aid. When the EW receives the DA 1 from the investigator, the EW must review the case and discontinue the parole or probation violator at the end of the month of discovery with a 10 day timely notice, if appropriate. No additional verification shall be required of individuals to verify the status of an applicant or recipient&#39;s parole or probation.</p>
  <p class="Reminder">Reminder: The <a href="#" data-popovertext="Fleeing Felon Match " data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">FFM</a> report provides counties with information for current recipients who are fleeing felons or parole or probation violators. Currently, the State sends the FFM report to the County <a href="#" data-popovertext="Special Investigation Unit " data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">SIU</a> and an investigator sends the “Public Assistance Fraud Match” (DA 1) to the EW. The EW is required to review the case and discontinue the parole or probation violator, if appropriate.</p>
  <p>For more information regarding the process for FFM, <span data-rhtags="2">Refer to Common Place Handbook Chapter 5.11</span></p>
  <h2>Fleeing Felon and Persons in Violation of Probation or Parole Violation<br/>
    [63-102f.(3), 63-102p.(2) &amp; 63-402.224 (a&amp;b)]</h2>
  <p>Individuals who are fleeing felons and persons in violation of their probation or parole are included as members of the household for the purpose of defining a household. However, such individuals are ineligible to receive CalFresh and are treated as excluded members.</p>
  <p class="Note">Note: Fleeing felons and probation/parole violators are treated in the same manner as individuals disqualified for an <a href="#" data-popovertext="Intentional Program Violation (63-801.23), An overissuance that has been judged by an Administrative Disqualification Hearing official, or by a court of the appropriate jurisdiction, as being caused by misrepresentation or concealment of the material facts by the household." data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">IPV</a>.</p>
  <h3>Fleeing Felon</h3>
  <p>“Fleeing Felon” is defined as an individual who is fleeing to avoid prosecution, custody or confinement after conviction of a crime or attempt to commit a crime, that is considered a felony under the law where the individual is fleeing.</p>
  <p>An individual is considered a fleeing felon when a federal, state, or local law enforcement officer, acting in an official capacity, presents an outstanding felony arrest warrant that conforms to one of three <a href="#" data-popovertext="National Crime Information Center " data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">NCIC</a> Uniform Offense Classification codes, to the County obtain information on the location of and other information about the individual named in the warrant. The information may also be discovered while working the Fleeing Felon Match report. An individual is a fleeing felon when a warrant for arrest is presented with one of three NCIC codes.</p>
  <p>The three NCIC codes are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Escape (4901)</li>
    <li>Flight to Avoid (prosecution, confinement, etc.) (4902)</li>
    <li>Flight-Escape (4999)</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="Note">Note: A felony is considered a high misdemeanor under the law of the state of New Jersey.</p>
  <h3>Definition of Probation/Parole Violation</h3>
  <p>To be considered a probation or parole violator, an impartial party, such as a judge or officially sanctioned tribunal, must determine that the individual violated a condition of his or her probation or parole imposed under federal or state lase and that federal, state, or local law enforcement authorities are <strong>actively seeking</strong> the individual to enforce the conditions of the probation or parole.</p>
  <h3>Actively Seeking for the Verification of Probation/Parole Violation</h3>
  <p>To determine if an individual is in violation of probation or parole, counties must verify that law enforcement is actively seeking the individual. Once the verification that an individual is a probation or parole violator and is being actively sought has been attained, the County must take immediate action to terminate or deny CalFresh benefits.</p>
  <h4>Verification Procedures</h4>
  <p>SIU contacts the law enforcement agency and allow the agency 20 calendar days from the date of the inquiry to respond to a request for information about the conditions of a probation or parole violation, and whether the law enforcement agency is actively seeking the individual.</p>
  <p>The following steps are required:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If The Law Enforcement Agency does not indicate that it intends to enforce the felony warrant or arrest the individual for the probation or parole violation within 30 days of the date of the County’s request for information, then the County must determine that the individual is NOT a probation or parole violator and document the household’s case file accordingly.</li>
    <li>If the Law Enforcement Agency indicates that it does intend to enforce the felony warrant or arrest the individual for the probation or parole violation within 30 days of the date of the county’s request for information, postpone taking any action on the case until the 30-day period has expired.</li>
    <li>Once the 30-day period as expired, the County must verify with the law enforcement agency whether it has attempted to arrest the probation or parole violator.
      <ul>
        <li>If It has, then the EW takes action to deny the applicant, or discontinue the probation/parole violator.</li>
        <li>If it has NOT taken any action within 30 days, then the must NOT consider the individual a probation or parole violator and take NO further action. Document the case file accordingly.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
