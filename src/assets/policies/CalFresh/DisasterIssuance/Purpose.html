    <h1><span data-field="title" data-format="default">Disaster CalFresh Program (DCFP)</span></h1>
    <p>These procedures are for use when a disaster causes the normal CalFresh issuance process to fail. (For example, an earthquake occurs and electricity and computer systems are disrupted for several days at <a href="#" data-popovertext="Social Security Administration " data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">SSA</a>.)</p>
    <p>These procedures are separate and distinct from the program called “Emergency Food Assistance in Disaster.” Refer to <a href="../HHMisfortune/AvaiEmrgncyAsstnce.html">Application Processing For Displaced Households Due To California Disasters and Replacement Benefits Due To Household Misfortune</a>.</p>
    <p>The “Disaster Issuance Procedures” described here may be implemented alone or together with the “Emergency Food Assistance in Disaster” program.</p>
    <h2><a id="DCFP"></a>Approval Process to Implement Disaster CalFresh Program (DCFP)</h2>
    <p>After a natural or man-made disaster occurs and a Presidential declaration of disaster with a provision for individual assistance has been made, SSA requests approval from <a href="#" data-popovertext="Food and Nutrition Service " data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">FNS</a> through <a href="#" data-popovertext="California Department of Social Services " data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">CDSS</a> to operate <a href="#" data-popovertext="Disaster CalFresh Program" data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">DCFP</a> to provide temporary food assistance to households. DCFP assists people to buy food when they are experiencing an economic hardship as a result of the disaster (loss of jobs, loss of food because of power outages, damages to home and personal possessions, etc.).</p>
    <p>The DCFP must be treated differently from the regular CalFresh Program. During the disaster period, normal CalFresh Program policies and procedures do not apply. The eligibility criteria regarding verification, income, resources, and citizenship status are relaxed.
      <br/>
      The time frame to apply for DCFP is generally seven to ten days from the date of the disaster.</p>
    <h2><a id="DisasterApp"></a>Disaster Application Sites</h2>
    <p>Three district offices are tentatively designated as centralized disaster application process sites: North County, South County and <a href="#" data-popovertext="Benefit Service Center " data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">BSC</a>. This designation may be changed at the time of a disaster, based on community needs and the functional state of these district offices.</p>
    <p>District offices designated as disaster application processing centers shall EACH have:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A generator for electrical power outages.</li>
      <li>Flashlights with live batteries (This requires periodic battery checks as a part of standard office procedures).</li>
      <li>Sufficient shelf-stock of the following forms:
        <ul>
          <li>Application for Disaster CalFresh (DFA 385)</li>
          <li>Income Worksheet (QR 30)</li>
          <li>Food Stamp Budget Worksheet (CF 286 SAR)</li>
          <li>Notice of Approval/Denial for Disaster CalFresh (DFA 390)</li>
          <li>Caseload Listing of Disaster Issuance (SCD 1310)</li>
          <li>Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) Miscellaneous On-Line Request (SCD 2201)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Information Systems</h3>
    <p>Data Processing at Information Systems (IS) has a generator which will maintain its computer systems during a disaster, barring physical destruction of the generator or the facility. IS will produce the “Benefits” report on a monthly basis and distribute it to each district office. This report lists the level of cash aid and CalFresh benefits issued for the month.</p>
    <h3>Informational Posting</h3>
    <p>Each SSA District Office shall have a notice prominently posted in the lobby listing open SSA offices.</p>
    <h2><a id="NewApps"></a>New Applicants/Continuing Households</h2>
    <h3>Issuance Process</h3>
    <p>The process below provides specific instructions for each stage and person involved in the benefit issuance process for:</p>
