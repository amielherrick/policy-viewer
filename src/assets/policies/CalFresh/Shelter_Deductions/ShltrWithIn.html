  <h1><span data-field="title" data-format="default">Shelter Proration - Within CalFresh HH</span></h1>
  <p>Within the CalFresh household, proration of rent is based on the number of contributors to the expense.</p>
  <p>Contributors are those household members:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Who share the residence and the expenses of that residence by paying or obligating money from their separate income or resources, or</li>
    <li>Who per regulations are automatically considered contributors.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>A determination must by made if an excluded member is a contributor. There are three separate categories of excluded household members. The treatment of each of these types of contributors is different and is as follows:</p>
  <p class="Note">Note: <a href="#" data-popovertext="Standard Utility Allowance " data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">SUA</a> is never prorated. The eligible CalFresh <a href="#" data-popovertext="Household" data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">HH</a> members are entitled to the full SUA.</p>
  <h2>Ineligible Student Excluded Members [63-502.373(c)]</h2>
  <p>If the CalFresh eligible household members share expenses with members who are excluded because they are ineligible students, fixed amounts contributed by these excluded members must be deducted from the allowable expense. Only the remaining dollar amount shall be allowed as the CalFresh household’s deduction. If an individual pays a fixed amount, he/she is:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Not considered a contributor, and</li>
    <li>Not included in the count if proration is required due to the presence of other excluded CalFresh HH members.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><a class="dropspot" data-rhwidget="DropSpot" data-target="drop-down" href="#"><span data-open-text="true" data-skip-index="true">Example</span><span data-close-text="true">Example</span></a></p>
  <div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop-down">
    <p>Two separate households share a house. Only one of the households receives CalFresh. Total rent: $1000 - each household pays 1/2 of the rent. CalFresh HH share of rent is $500. SUA is allowed in the CalFresh budget.</p>
    <p>The CalFresh HH consists of an SSI grandmother, her daughter who is working and is an ineligible non-citizen and her citizen granddaughter. They purchase and prepare food together. SSI grandmother pays $200 of the rent and $25 of the PG&amp;E bill.</p>
    <p>CalFresh HH Rent: $500 minus $200 rent paid by SSI grandmother equals $300.<br/>
      $300 rent divided by 2 contributors (mother and daughter) = $150 rent allowed in the CalFresh budget.</p>
    <p>SUA is allowed in the CalFresh budget.</p>
  </div>
  <p>If payments or contributions made by these excluded members can not be differentiated (i.e. pooled income), the expense is prorated evenly among the members contributing to the expense and only the eligible members and IPV/work requirement sanctioned members prorated share is counted as the deduction. In this situation, the excluded Ineligible student member is:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Considered a contributor, and</li>
    <li>Included in the count for the proration.</li>
  </ul>

      Their share of rent is $600. CalFresh HH Rent of $600 is divided by 3 contributors (mother and 2 children)= $200 x 2 eligible CalFresh HH members= $400 (amount allowed in the CalFresh budget).</p>
