  <h2>Students Under Age 18</h2>
  <h3>Loans, Grants, Scholarships, etc.</h3>
  <p>Subtract exempt expenses and count the remainder as income to the household. This income is treated the same for all students, regardless of the student&#39;s age. Refer to <a href="InelgblStdnts.html#Income">Exemptions [63-507(a)(6)]</a> for further information.</p>

  <p>This exemption applies to work study earnings and other jobs. For further information, refer to Earnings.</p>
  <h2>Third-Party Payments</h2>
  <p>Student income provided to a third party to meet the household&#39;s living expenses shall be treated as money payable directly to the household and not considered a vendor payment. Living expenses may include, but are not limited to:</p>

  <h2>Income Paid Directly to the School</h2>
  <p>Grants, scholarships, fellowships, veteran&#39;s benefits, and loans are sometimes paid directly to the school, not the student. Once awarded, this money is legally obligated to the student. It must be counted as unearned income and averaged over the school term after subtracting exempt educational expenses.</p>
  <h2>Countable Income</h2>
  <p>Any student income, after exclusions, must be averaged over the period for which it was provided. Countable student financial aid includes: </p>
  <p> </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Any non-needs-based awards and scholarships, including private scholarships, some athletic scholarships, some fellowship grants, or other non-needs-based grants, are counted as unearned income when they are:
      <ul>
        <li>not indicated as exempt in the income exclusion chart above </li>
        <li>not received by a dependent child, and</li>
        <li>not earmarked, used for, or intended to be used for qualifying educational expenses.</li>

    </li>
    <li>Any loans, not otherwise exempt, that do not have a written agreement and repayment plan.</li>
    <li>Housing allowance, subsistence payments, portions of VA educational, vocational, training, and rehabilitation benefits, and programs are countable as income.

      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Stipends for educational/research and employment purposes when participating in a particular program or major. Regardless of the receipt date, the stipend income is to be averaged over the period for which it was provided – typically a semester. Any amount that can be verified as spent on allowable educational expenses can be excluded from consideration prior to averaging.</li>
    <li>New applicants who are members of the AmeriCorps VISTA program and were not receiving public assistance or CalFresh when they joined VISTA will have any payments received from the program counted as earned income.</li>
  </ul>
  <p> </p>
  <p class="Reminder">Reminder: Under Semi-Annual Reporting (SAR), CalFresh benefits are determined using prospective budgeting and reasonably anticipated income. Prospective budgeting requires that the county determine CalFresh eligibility based on a household’s reasonably anticipated circumstances. Reasonably anticipated income is any income the household can reasonably anticipate receiving over the length of the certification period.</p>
  <h3>Verification</h3>
  <p>When needed, Income verification must include all of the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Amount</li>
    <li>Source</li>
    <li>Period the income is meant to cover.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Income may be verified by a:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Financial aid award letter from the school/grantor, or</li>
    <li><em>Student Income Verification Request</em> (CSF 50) completed by the school.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Exempt Expenses</h3>
  <p>Exempt educational expenses on the Standard Student Budget must be verified by one of the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A <em>Student Income Verification Request</em> (CSF 50) completed by the school, or</li>
    <li>A copy of the educational institution&#39;s “Standard Student Budget” with information to identify the specific budget category used for the student (such as “living at home” versus “away from home”).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The format of the Standard Student Budget will vary by educational facility. If the institution&#39;s Financial Aid Department provides written documentation/verification of the necessary amounts, the EW shall accept this and make the appropriate budget computation.</p>
