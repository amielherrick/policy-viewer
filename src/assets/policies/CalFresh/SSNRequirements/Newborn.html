  <h1><span data-field="title" data-format="default">Newborn</span></h1>
  <p>A household’s inability to provide a newborn’s SSN or proof of application for an SSN does not disqualify the newborn from participating in CalFresh. Newborns qualify for presumptive eligibility for CalFresh for six months from their date of birth without providing SSN.</p>
  <p>If a household is unable to show proof of application for an SSN or provide SSN for a newborn, they can provide an SSN or proof of application for an SSN at their next recertification or within six months following the month the baby is born, whichever is later. If the household cannot provide an SSN or proof of application for an SSN at its next recertification within 6 months following the newborn&#39;s birth, the EW must determine if the good cause is applicable.</p>
  <p class="Note">Reminder: An application form must not be required for adding a newborn to CalFresh. Households may verbally report the information and must not be required to complete any application forms, including the Statement of Facts for an Additional Person (CW 8) or Statement of Facts to Add a Child Under Age 16 (CW 8A). While the CW 8A may be required for CalWORKs for combo cases, the newborn must be added to CalFresh the month following the verbal report of the newborn and date of birth, regardless of if or when the CW 8 or CW 8A is returned for CalWORKs.</p>
  <h2>Verifying SSN for Newborns</h2>
  <p>When the sixth month following the birth of the child is after the household’s recertification, the EW must send a Request for Verification (CW 2200) form after the report of the child’s birth and give at least ten days for the household to get the requested information. If the household fails to provide adequate verification or does not provide a qualifying good cause reason by the due date, the newborn will be ineligible for CalFresh beginning the seventh month following their birth.</p>
  <p>When the sixth month following the child’s birth is before the household’s recertification, the EW must follow the regular recertification rules to request the SSN verification for the child. If the household fails to provide adequate verification or does not provide a qualifying good cause reason, the newborn will be ineligible for CalFresh beginning the new recertification period.<br/>
    As a reminder, a notice of reducing benefits must be sent 10 days before the effective date. Therefore, in this instance, the EWs are recommended to send a CW 2200 after the report of the child’s birth but at least 20 days prior to the end of the sixth month.<br/>
    <a class="dropspot" data-rhwidget="DropSpot" data-target="drop-down" href="#"><span data-open-text="true" data-skip-index="true">Example</span><span data-close-text="true">Example</span></a>

  <div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop-down">
    <p>November - baby born<br/>
      December - household reports birth<br/>
      February - recertification due<br/>
      May - sixth month following birth</p>
    <p><br/>
      An infant was born in November. The CalFresh household reports the newborn in December, but cannot verify that an SSN application was filed for the newborn. The household’s recertification is due in February. The sixth month following the child’s birth month is May.<br/>
      Because the recertification month is sooner than the sixth month following the birth, the infant will continue to receive CalFresh benefits through May 31. If the household is unable to provide the newborn’s SSN at the recertification due in February, the EW must remind the household to provide the newborn’s SSN verification by sending the CW 2200 with a due date of May 21. The CW 2200 should list that the household must either provide the child’s SSN, application for an SSN, or good cause for not applying for an SSN in order for the infant to maintain eligibility beyond May 31. If the household has not provided the requested information by May 21, the EW must provide 10 day notice for the change in benefits (effective the June benefit month) and send the household a Notice of Action stating that the child will be ineligible for CalFresh beginning June 1.</p>

    <p>November - baby born<br/>
      December - household reports birth<br/>
      May - sixth month following birth<br/>
      August - recertification due</p>
    <p><br/>
      An infant was born in November. The CalFresh household reports the newborn in December and cannot verify that an SSN application was filed for the child. The household’s recertification is due in August, and the sixth month following the child’s birth is May. Because the recertification month is later than the sixth month following the birth, the infant will continue receiving CalFresh benefits through the recertification period. If the household fails to provide the child’s SSN during recertification, the EW must send a CW 2200 requesting proof of the child’s SSN, application for an SSN, or good cause for not applying for an SSN. If the household has not provided the verification or good cause reason by the CW 2200 due date but has otherwise completed the recertification and continues to meet all other eligibility conditions, the household will be recertified, but the newborn will be an excluded member beginning the new certification period.</p>
  </div>
  <h2><a id="Failure"></a>Failure to Comply</h2>
  <p>If the EW determines that a household member has refused or failed without good cause to provide or apply for an SSN, then that individual must be ineligible to participate in CalFresh. The disqualification applies to the individual for whom the SSN is not provided and not to the entire household. The earned or unearned income and resources of an individual disqualified from the household for failure to comply with this requirement shall be counted as household income and resources to the extent specified in the Excluded Member Chapter of the CalFresh handbook.</p>
  <h2><a id="GoodCause"></a>Determining Good Cause</h2>
  <p>If the household is unable to provide verification of SSN or SSN application, the EW must determine if the household has good cause for not complying. If good cause is found, the EW must ensure there is no break in aid and approve benefits for an additional month.</p>
  <p>Federal law provides the following guidelines for determining good cause:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The County must consider information from multiple sources including the household member and Social Security Administration (SSA).</li>
    <li>The County must accept documentary evidence or collateral contact information that the household member has applied for an SSN or made every effort to supply SSA with the necessary information to complete an application for an SSN as good cause.</li>
    <li>Good cause must not include delays due to illness, lack of transportation or temporary absences.</li>
    <li>If the household member applying for an SSN has been unable to obtain the documents required by SSA, the eligibility worker must make every effort to assist the individual in obtaining these documents.</li>
    <li>Good cause for failure to apply for an SSN must be determined monthly in order for the newborn to continue to participate in CalFresh.</li>
    <li>There is no limit to the number of months good cause can be granted, but the EW may require new or updated verification if the good cause becomes questionable.</li>
