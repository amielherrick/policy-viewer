  <h1><span data-field="title" data-format="default">Definition of a Complete SAR 7</span></h1>
  <h2>Completeness Criteria (ACL 21-24)</h2>
  <p>The SAR 7 must now be considered complete if:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>The form is signed and dated (any date) by the persons specified by the household or Authorized Representative;</li>
    <li>All questions and items were fully answered, and information provided on the SAR 7 form together with attached documentation, provides enough information to allow for the determination of eligibility and benefit level; and</li>
    <li>All required verifications are provided.</li>
  </ol>
  <p class="Note">Note: Since it is also signed under penalty of perjury, faxed SAR 7s are acceptable. If questionable, follow-up by requesting that the original also be sent in.</p>
  <p class="Note">Additionally, the SAR 7 may be completed in ink, pencil or any other writing utensil the client has at their disposal.</p>
  <h2>Signature [63-508.43]</h2>
  <p>The SAR 7 must be signed by one of the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Head of household, or</li>
    <li>Authorized representative, or</li>
    <li>A responsible household member.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Date [63-508.41]</h2>
  <p>The SAR 7 must be signed and dated by the household or AR. AB 79 eliminated the requirement for the SAR 7 to be signed no earlier than the first day of the submit month for the he SAR 7 to be considered complete.</p>
  <p class="Note">Note: As long as the household answered all the questions and provided he required verifications for the data month, then the SAR 7 is considered complete regardless of the date it is signed. (AB 79 Webinar).</p>
  <h2>Sponsored Noncitizens</h2>
  <p>Sponsored noncitizens must report their sponsor&#39;s income and changes in circumstances on the SAR 7. Noncitizens must also provide verification of their sponsor&#39;s income/circumstances which may affect the CalFresh.</p>
  <p>The sponsor is NOT required to sign the SAR 7.</p>
  <h2>Complete Answers</h2>
  <p>An answer to any SAR 7 question is complete if:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The “NO” box is checked.</li>
    <li>The “NO” box is checked for Question #1, but wage stubs for the data month are attached. (The “NO” check is assumed to be inadvertent.)</li>
    <li>The “YES” box is NOT checked BUT the information is provided on the form and the required verification is attached.</li>
    <li>The “YES” box is checked, information is NOT provided on the report, BUT the required verification (including date received) is attached showing ALL of the information necessary to determine eligibility and benefit amounts.</li>
    <li>The “YES” box is NOT checked, information is NOT provided in the report BUT the required verification (including date received) is attached showing ALL of the information necessary to determine eligibility and benefit amounts.</li>
    <li>The household reports a change in deductions (other than housing), but fails to provide verification. Although the SAR 7 is considered “complete”, the deduction will be disallowed IF verification is required.
      <ul>
        <li>Refer to <a href="DefCmpltSAR7.html">Deductions</a> for more information.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The number of days and hours worked are NOT reported for a wage earner whose unemployment status constitutes a basis of deprivation.</li>
    <li>A change in resources is not listed when it does not cause ineligibility.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The following information is not required to be reported on the SAR 7:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Public Assistance (PA) or GA grant amounts.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Incomplete Answers</h2>
  <p>An answer to any SAR 7 question is INCOMPLETE and a “NA 960Y SAR” NOA must be sent if:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The “YES” or “NO” box is not checked and the information is NOT provided on the form, and the required verification is not attached. (That is, the question is blank and nothing is attached.)</li>
    <li>The “YES” box is checked, but no information is provided and the required verification is not attached.</li>
    <li>The information is provided on the report, but verification required to determine ELIGIBILITY (such as income) is not attached.
      <ul>
        <li>Exception: DO NOT send a “NA 960Y SAR” NOA for missing verification of a deduction. [Refer to “Deductions,” page 25-8] for further information.]</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Verify gross nonexempt earned income semi-annually.</li>
    <li>Verify nonexempt unearned income when it is first reported and when the amount changes.
      <ul>
        <li>Note: All CalFresh households are not required to report a change of $100 or less in unearned income on the SAR 7 form.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Verify exempt income when it is first reported and when the source changes. (This includes income-in-kind.)</li>
    <li>The recipient reported any change of circumstance outside of the SAR 7 (mid-period change)</li>
    <li>When a submitted SAR 7 does not contain information from a previous (voluntary) unverified report, an action must be taken to resolve the discrepancy between the two reports before changing benefits for the upcoming semi-annual period. If the discrepancy cannot be resolve the SAR 7 may be treated as incomplete.</li>
    <li><a class="dropspot" data-rhwidget="DropSpot" data-target="drop-down2" href="#"><span data-open-text="true" data-skip-index="true">Example</span><span data-close-text="true">Example</span></a>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p class="Note">Exception: The household is only required to report shelter cost changes at recertification or when the HH moves. If a household voluntarily reports a decrease in housing costs mid-period, the next SAR 7 is NOT considered incomplete if the household fails to report it since the change wasn’t required to be reported.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop-down2">
        <p>A household is in January through June SAR Payment period. On March 15, mom reports she is eligible for Social Security and the first payment of $300 will be received April 3. No verification was received and no action was taken since the income was under 130% of FPL. The ‘No Change NOA’ was sent and the report was documented in case record for the next SAR 7 or RC. When the SAR 7 is received in June, the Social Security payment was not reported. The EW must contact the client to resolve the discrepancy.</p>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>The SAR 7 is NOT signed and dated by the appropriate person. Refer to <a href="DefCmpltSAR7.html">Signature [63-508.43]</a>.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Reporting Requirements on the Semi-Annual Report (SAR 7)</h2>
  <p>The SAR recipients must provide information and answers to all questions and items on the SAR 7 and attest, under penalty of perjury, that they have truthfully reported all required information. The SAR 7 is not an affidavit of income and does not count as attestation. It is an affidavit of the change in income, therefore, the household needs to verify the change in income in addition to reporting it on the SAR 7.</p>
  <p>Income verification, e.g. pay stubs, is not required to be included with the SAR 7 if information on the SAR 7 is consistent with what was previously reported. If new, changed, or terminated income is reported then verification is required.<br/>
    The following items are reporting requirements which require verification when first reported in the SAR 7 or when there is a change:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Gross nonexcluded earned income and nonexcluded unearned income.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p class="Note">Exception: Households are not required to report a change of $100 or less in unearned income on the SAR 7 form.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Source and amount of all excluded income when first reported on the SAR7 and any changes in the source and amount of the income.</li>
    <li>Verification for actual costs of producing self employment income.</li>
    <li>Residency when there is a change.</li>
    <li>Social security numbers or citizenship or noncitizen status for household members when there is a change.</li>
    <li>A change in the legal obligation to pay child support to a person not in CalFresh household and/or an increase in the amount of child support payments.</li>
    <li>A change in household composition or loss of job or source of earned income on the applicability of the work registration or voluntary quit requirements.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p class="Note">Note: If verification does not exist or is not available, an affidavit or sworn statement is acceptable verification of earnings. Collateral contacts may also be used for the households.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Refer to <a href="../Verification/Overview.html">Verification</a> for information on verification requirements.</p>
  <p>Households are NOT required to report the following changes in expenses, but verification must be requested if a household does report changes in allowable medical expenses for an aged/disabled household member.</p>
  <p>If the household fails to provide verification of a change of expense when one is reported. Refer to <a href="DefCmpltSAR7.html">Missing</a><a href="DefCmpltSAR7.html"> Information/Verification</a> to determine the required action.</p>
  <h3>Consistency</h3>
  <p>Evaluate the answers to questions on the SAR 7 for consistency with each other, and with previous case information.</p>
  <h3>Missing Information/Verification</h3>
  <p>When required information or verification of a deduction is not included with the SAR 7, follow the steps below. DO NOT send a “NA 960Y SAR” NOA or otherwise delay benefits.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Send a “CalFresh Notice of Change For Semi-Annual Reporting Household” (CF 377.4) listing the missing information/verification.
      <ol>
        <li>If a handwritten CF 377.4 is sent, check the boxes “Change in Benefits” and “Proposed Change in Benefits” and document the specific missing information on the Maintain Case Comments window.
          <ol>
            <li>If the change is an unverified increase in housing AND the HH did not move, then 
              <ol>
                <li>Enter the increased amount in the future SAR Payment Period budget, unless questionable.</li>
                <li>Continue to allow the new amount whether or not verification is received.</li>
                <li>If verification is received, make sure to check that the information is consistent with the case record.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>If the change is an unverified decrease in housing AND the HH did not move, then 
              <ol>
                <li>Enter the decreased amount in the future SAR Payment Period budget.</li>
                <li>Send a second NOA (CF 377.4) 10-days in advance to notify the household of the decrease in benefits.</li>
                <li>Continue to allow the new amount whether or not verification is received.</li>
                <li>If verification is received, make sure to check that the information is consistent with the case record.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>If the change is any other change in expenses (such as a move) with missing information/verification, then 
              <ol>
                <li>Enter the NEW amount in the future SAR Payment Period budget, unless questionable.</li>
                <li>Send a second change NOA (CF 377.4) to notify the household of the resulting change in benefits. 10-day notice is required for a benefit decrease.</li>
                <li>Continue to allow the new amount whether or not verification is received.</li>
                <li>If verification is received, make sure to check that the information is consistent with the case record.</li>

          </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h3>EW Responsibility</h3>
  <p>EWs must make every effort to clear questionable information by the extended filing date. This may be done through a telephone call, text or mail.</p>
  <h2>Other Questionable Missing Information/Verification [63-300.5, 63-508.613]</h2>
  <p>If information or verification is questionable for ELIGIBILITY items such as a change in residency, citizenship or noncitizen status, and the household has failed to provide clarification, follow the steps below.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Call the client<br/>
      or <br/>
      Send a text message via “Message Media” to ask the client to contact the EW;<br/>
      or<br/>
      If the household’s consent for text is not on file, send a “Request for Information” (CF 387), requesting the missing information and/or verification and allowing the household at least 10 days to provide it.
      <ol>
        <li>Do not send a NA 960Y SAR NOA.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>IF THE HOUSEHOLD FAILS* to provide the missing information/verification by the due date, then Issue a timely (10-day) NOA to terminate the CalFresh benefits for failure to provide information.</li>
    <li>IF THE HOUSEHOLD REFUSES* to provide the missing information/verification, then Discontinue the household for REFUSAL to provide information.
      <ol>
        <li>Document on the Maintain Case Comments window.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ol>
