  <h3>Application</h3>
  <p>Residents of a <a href="#" data-popovertext="Drug Addiction or Alcoholic " data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">DAA</a> Treatment Center must apply for <a href="#" data-popovertext="CalFresh " data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">CF</a> voluntarily, DAA Treatment Centers cannot require residents to apply for CF. If a resident voluntarily applies for CF, they MUST apply through an <a href="#" data-popovertext="Authorized Representative " data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">AR</a> who is employed by and designated by the DAA Treatment Center. CF applications may be filed in person, mail, fax, electronic mail, or by completing a <a href="#" data-popovertext="MyBenefits CalWIN " data-rhwidget="TextPopOver">MyBCW</a> application.</p>
  <p class="Important">Important: The DAA Treatment Center employee designated for the purpose of applying must also act as the AR for recertification purposes. The AR is responsible for notifying the county of changes in the household’s circumstances that are required to be reported during the certification period.</p>
  <p>The application forms may be signed by the resident household or the AR. The AR is designated by completing the CF 100, CalFresh Request for Authorized Representative Drug or Alcohol Treatment Center Resident. The AR must sign the form “Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) Request for Designated Alternate Cardholder/Authorized Representative” (CSF 64).<br/>
     </p>
  <p class="Note">Note: A CalFresh application must not be denied to residents of drug and alcohol treatment centers because the AR did not initiate the application. However, the certification MUST be done through the AR.</p>
  <p>The institution must receive and spend the CalFresh benefits for food prepared by and/or served to the residents of the center.</p>
  <h3>HH Composition</h3>
  <p>Authorize benefits as a separate household for an addict/alcoholic and their children who live at the treatment center and are provided with meals. (Parents and children must be one household.)</p>
  <p>The spouse or family members other than children who live at the treatment center:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>May receive CalFresh if meals are not provided to them (they are treated as a roomer and must be a separate household from the addict/alcoholic and their children).</li>
    <li>Are ineligible for CalFresh if meals are provided to them.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>CalWORKs Income</h3>
  <p>When a drug/alcoholic treatment center resident has CalWORKs income and is not in the same CalFresh household with the other CalWORKs recipients, prorate the grant equally among the CalWORKs AU members. Count the addict&#39;s/alcoholic&#39;s prorated share of the CalWORKs grant as income. Refer to <a href="../ExcludedNHMembers/Non-Household_Members.html">Combined Payments</a>.</p>
  <h3>HH Rights</h3>
  <p>All changes in household circumstances and recertifications shall be processed using the same standards that apply to all other CalFresh household.</p>
  <p>All rights to Notices of Adverse Action, to State Hearings, and to entitlement to lost benefits shall be applied. In this respect, there is no difference between the households and other households.</p>
  <h3>Work Registration [63-407.21(f)]</h3>
  <p>A participating resident is exempt from work registration requirements.</p>
  <h3>CalFresh EBT Card</h3>
  <p>When a resident leaves the treatment center, the treatment center’s EBT card must be deactivated and a new EBT card issued to the client.</p>
  <p class="Reminder">Reminder: The primary cardholder must also be changed from the Authorized Representative (AR) of the Treatment Center to the client.</p>
  <h3>Treatment Center Responsibilities [63-503.476: ACL 19-51]</h3>
  <p>The treatment center shall:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide to the CalFresh Coordinator a certified list of currently participating residents on a monthly basis. The County will conduct periodic random on-site visits to assure accuracy of these list.</li>
    <li>Notify the EW of changes in income, household circumstances, and when resident leaves center.</li>
    <li>Advise the household who leaves the center to contact their EW to be issued an EBT card.</li>
    <li>When a household leaves the DAA Treatment Center, the center must adhere to the following requirements:
      <ul>
        <li>Notify the County by sending a completed change report form to the County with the household’s change in address, new address if available, and a statement that the DAA treatment Center and employee are no longer the household’s AR.</li>
        <li>Provide a change report form as soon as it finds out that the household plans to leave the facility and must advise the household to return the change report form to the County within 10 days of any change in the household’s circumstances that the household is required to report. After the household leaves the DAA Treatment Center, the center can no longer act as the household’s AR for certification purposes, obtaining benefits, or using benefits.</li>
        <li>Provide the household with its EBT card if the DAA Treatment Center was keeping the EBT card. The DAA Treatment Center must return to the County any EBT cards not provided to departing households by the end of each month in which the households left the DAA Treatment Center.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Return household benefits as follows:
      <ul>
        <li>If no benefits have been spent on behalf of the individual household, the DAA center must return the full value of any benefits already debited from the household’s current monthly allotment back onto the household’s EBT account at the time the household leaves the DAA Treatment Center.</li>
        <li>If benefits have already been debited from the EBT account and any portion spent on half of an individual household, the following procedures must be followed:
          <ul>
            <li>If the household leaves prior to the 16th day of the month, the DAA Center must ensure that the household has one-half of its monthly allotment remaining on its EBT account.</li>
            <li>If the household leaves on or after the 16th day of the month, the DAA Treatment Center must return the household a portion of its allotment back. If the DDA treatment Center is authorized as a retailer, the DAA treatment center can refund that amount back to the EBT account when the household leaves.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>In either case, the household, not the DAA Treatment Center, must be allowed to have sole access to any benefits remaining in the household’s EBT account when the household leaves the DAA center.</li>
        <li>If the household has already left the DAA center and, as a result, the DAA Center is unable to return the benefits the DAA center must advise the County and return the benefits to the County.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Be strictly liable for all losses or misuse of CalFresh benefits held on behalf of resident households and for all overissuances which occur while the households are residents of the treatment center, regardless of cause. The EW shall establish a claim for any overissuances of CalFresh benefits received on behalf of a resident household.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Both the intake and continuing EW must remind all ARs at application and recertification of the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Careful and continuing review of a resident&#39;s circumstances are required before application for CalFresh, and during the receipt of continuing benefits.</li>
    <li>It is the responsibility of the AR to ensure that the correct information about the resident&#39;s circumstances are reported to the EW.</li>
    <li>The AR must review the DAA Treatment and Rehabilitation Center Responsibilities (SCD 2499).</li>
  </ul>
